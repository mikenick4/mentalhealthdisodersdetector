    "title": "Please read this before posting about feeling suicidal.",
    "content": "There has been an increase in the number of posts of individuals who are feeling suicidal. And to be perfectly honest, most of us have been isolated, scared, lonely, and there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the world due to COVID.\n\nUnfortunately, most of us in this community are not trained to handle mental health crises. While I and a handful of others are licensed professionals, an anonymous internet forum is not the best place to really provide the correct amount of help and support you need.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not surprised that many of us in this community are struggling. For those who are struggling, you are not alone. I may be doing well now, but I have two attempts and OCD was a huge factor.\n\nI have never regretted being stopped.\n\nSince you are thinking of posting for help, you won't regret stopping yourself.\n\nSo, right now everything seems dark and you don\u2019t see a way out. That\u2019s ok. However, I guarantee you there is a light. Your eyes just have not adjusted yet.\n\nSo what can you do in this moment when everything just seems awful.\n\nFirst off, if you have a plan and you intend on carrying out that plan, I very strongly suggest going to your nearest ER. If you do not feel like you can keep yourself safe, you need to be somewhere where others can keep you safe. Psych hospitals are not wonderful places, they can be scary and frustrating. but you will be around to leave the hospital and get yourself moving in a better direction.\n\nIf you are not actively planning to suicide but the thought is very loud and prominent in your head, let's start with some basics. When\u2019s the last time you had food or water? Actual food; something with vegetables, grains, and protein. If you can\u2019t remember or it\u2019s been more than 4 to 5 hours, eat something and drink some water. Your brain cannot work if it does not have fuel.\n\nNext, are you supposed to be sleeping right now? If the answer is yes go to bed. Turn on some soothing music or ambient sounds so that you can focus on the noise and the sounds rather than ruminating about how bad you feel.\n\nIf you can\u2019t sleep, try progressive muscle relaxation or some breathing exercises. Have your brain focus on a scene that you find relaxing such as sitting on a beach and watching the waves rolling in or sitting by a brook and listening to the water. Go through each of your five senses and visualize as well as imagine what your senses would be feeling if you were in that space.\n\nIf you\u2019re hydrated, fed, and properly rested, ask yourself these questions when is the last time you talked to an actual human being? And I do mean talking as in heard their actual voice. Phone calls count for this one. If it\u2019s been a while. Call someone. It doesn\u2019t matter who, just talk to an actual human being.\n\nGo outside. Get in nature. This actually has research behind it. There is a bacteria or chemical in soil that also happens to be in the air that has mood boosting properties. There are literally countries where doctors will prescribe going for a walk in the woods to their patients.\n\nWhen is the last time you did something creative? If depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder have gotten in the way of doing creative things that you love, pull out that sketchbook or that camera and just start doing things.\n\nWhen\u2019s the last time you did something kind for another human being? This may just be me as a social worker, but doing things for others, helps me feel better. So figure out a place you can volunteer and go do it.\n\nWhen is the last time that you did something pleasurable just for pleasure's sake? Read a book take a bath. You will have to force yourself to do something but that\u2019s OK.\n\nYou have worth and you can get through this. Like I said I have had two attempts and now I am a licensed social worker. Things do get better, you just have to get through the dark stuff first.\n\nYou will be ok and you can make it through this.\n\nWe are all rooting for you.\n\nhttps://www.supportiv.com/tools/international-resources-crisis-and-warmlines"

    "title": "Reassurance seeking and providing: Rules of this subreddit and other information",
    "content": "There has been some confusion regarding reassurance seeking and providing in this subreddit.\n\n**Reassurance seeking** (a person asking for reassurance) is **allowed only if it is limited** \u2014 **no repeated seeking of reassurance**.\n\n**Reassurance providing** (a person giving reassurance) is **not allowed**.\n\n## What constitutes reassurance providing?\n\nBefore commenting on a reassurance-seeking question, answer to yourself this question: Are you **directly** answering what the person is asking, and is the answer meant to cause the person to feel better?\n\n**If the answer leads towards a \"yes\", refrain from commenting.**\n\n## How should I comment on reassurance-seeking questions then?\n\nThe issue concerned in reassurance-seeking questions is the emotional obsessive distress that is occurring in the moment, **not the question itself**.\n\nWhen you answer those reassurance-seeking questions to quell the person's emotional obsessive distress, **it's an act of providing emotional comfort to the person** \u2014 even if you don't have such explicit intention in mind \u2014 rather than an act of providing knowledge.\n\nThe person just wants to know they are \"fine\" in relation to the obsessive question/thought. **The answer itself is irrelevant** \u2014 that's why we don't answer questions of a reassurance-seeking nature directly.\n\n**You can comment in any way you want \u2014 even providing encouragement and hope \u2014 but refrain from addressing the reassurance-seeking question itself.**\n\n## What if the reassurance-seeking question turns out to be true?\n\nConsider this question: What if the reassurance-seeking question didn't even occur in the first place? What then?\n\nWe can go round and round with more \"what-ifs\", but it circles back to the fact that reality is uncertain, and will always be uncertain. **That is why the acceptance of uncertainty is crucial to recovery.**\n\n## Does that mean the reassurance-seeking question is totally invalid? Because I had a question that was based on reality.\n\nTake note that in the context of OCD, the issue rests with how a person is dealing with the issues, **and not so much the issues themselves**.\n\n**The issues can be entirely valid**, but what we are dealing with here \u2014 especially with reassurance \u2014 is **how we respond** to such issues.\n\n**Separate the reassurance part \u2014 the emotional comfort part \u2014 from the issues themselves.**\n\n## All of this is not true. My therapist taught me in the beginning of therapy that these thoughts are not true, and then I got better.\n\nIt's important to understand the intent and purpose of each and every information provided.\n\nWhen a person with OCD is beginning to learn about OCD, they can be taught, for example, that the obsessive thoughts do not reflect on their true character.\n\nThe intent and purpose of that example information is **cognitive-based** \u2014 to educate the person \u2014 and that helps to, subsequently, **be followed up by ERP, which is behavioural-based** \u2014 hence **cognitive-behavioural therapy** (of which ERP is a part of).\n\nWhen a person seeks reassurance, it is mostly solely behavioural: **the concern here is to quell the emotional obsessive distress** \u2014 take that emotional obsessive distress away, and the reassurance-seeking question suddenly becomes largely irrelevant and of less urgency.\n\n## This is so un-compassionate. Are we seriously going to let these people suffer?\n\nProviding reassurance doesn't really help the person not suffer either \u2014 the way out of that suffering is through the proper therapy and treatment, **and providing reassurance to the person only interferes with this process**.\n\nConsider as well that if reassurance is provided to the person, where an outcome is guaranteed to the person (\"You won't be this! I guarantee you!\").\n\n**What if the reassurance turns out to be false? What happens then? How much more distressful would the person be (given that they would've trusted the reassurance to keep them safe, only now for their entire world to fall apart)?**\n\nBefore considering that not providing reassurance is un-compassionate, perhaps it's also wise to consider what providing reassurance can lead to as well.\n\nThe reality will always be uncertain, as it is. There is no such solution that guarantees the person won't suffer, but we can at least minimise the suffering **by doing what is helpful towards the person** (especially in terms of the therapy and treatment) \u2014 and that doesn't always necessarily entail making the person feel better in the moment."

    "title": "Harm flowing into (I think) existential OCD? (TW: suicidal thoughts)",
    "content": "So I made a post yesterday about what I've been dealing with regarding what my therapist believes is harm/suicidal OCD, which can be described mostly accurately by the article that I linked. Also here: https://www.treatmyocd.com/blog/suicidal-ocd-signs-symptoms-and-treatment\n\nMy compulsions seem to be almost completely mental. Obsessing over and reviewing my thoughts and feelings, asking if these thoughts are truly indicative of some true or subconscious desire to die, wondering what they say about my mental and emotional state, feeling scared over whether the suicidal thoughts or wishing I could stop existing or any depressed feelings came first (and some thoughts like that do pop up, but I think thats more of a self-fulfilling prophecy). Also obsessive internet research, seeking reassurance, repeating to myself reasons why I don't actually fit the depression symptoms and why I have everything to live for, and that \"call of the void\" intrusive thoughts happen to everyone. \n\nThen, as if to keep testing my limits, my thoughts started trying to pick apart everything I've believed about my purpose in life, what's important and joyful in life, why life and existence are good and sacred, everything that has given me comfort and faith. Imposing impossible standards for what \"meaning\" and \"purpose\" in life are, and wondering if life (human or otherwise) has any inherent value or purpose at all, or if that's just a conceit of the human survival instinct. Whether there was actually any point to surviving and striving and improving given that we're eventually going to die, especially in very difficult circumstances, or if that was merely a cruel trick of evolutionary drives, and that we're all a bunch of deluded suckers for listening to it. Whether or not we actually have an eternal soul/consciousness or if we're nothing but flesh bags, and that \"we\" are merely an illusion of brain chemistry. Wondering if I as an individual have any inherent value and if there's a reason for me specifically to exist, and then wondering if/hoping we do actually have souls/eternal consciousnesses, and what the nature of the afterlife is. Finally, I wonder why there is any existence at all, why the universe and life exist and why God created it (if he did). \n\nAll of this has made me feel actually kind of depressed, which then just reinforces the harm OCD. It's like my brain is trying to make things seem as difficult, pointless, and bleak as possible to really test my limits. It feels hard to focus on or care about anything until I have positive, relieving answers to all these questions. \n\nI need to know if anyone else has experienced such things before, and if I've found the right label for this theme. If you have, what did you do about it? I remember going through something similar as a kid and later a teenager, and briefly again in college. All these thoughts and feelings are fairly ego dystonic for me, I suppose I'm afraid of being wrong about my life philosophy. "

For the last few years I\u2019ve struggled with what I thought was generalized anxiety disorder, and the last year in particular has been really rough. It was only when I mentioned constant rumination, fact checking, and obsessive thought patterns to my therapist (who specializes in anxiety) when she mentioned that this was sounding more like OCD and not anxiety. She recommended her colleague who is a psychologist and OCD s specialist for me to see instead, and for a month I was in denial. When I read more into OCD and mental compulsions my jaw was on the floor, it was as if someone was literally writing about me and my struggles that have been happening for years. Therapy and lexapro both didn\u2019t seem to be doing anything for me, and after seeing the psychologist and getting a diagnosis, I\u2019m now switching to Prozac. This feels like such a breakthrough in my mental health, but also I am terrified of what the future holds for me. I\u2019ve been crying so much because of how much I\u2019ve struggled and now I know this is something I\u2019ll have to work through in a different way. I\u2019m just looking for positive stories or words of encouragement. I know that now with a proper diagnosis, ERP therapy, and medication that might actually start helping that I can get better.

This thought comes very quickly. Then I start ruminating about this  (which feels like a compulsion), but I don't know if it's OCD or not. How can I tell what my thoughts really are?\n\nI've also noticed that when I learn about something unfair in the news and I don't have the appropriate emotional response (compassion, sadness), I feel guilty and force myself to put myself in the shoes of the person who experienced the injustice, and in the shoes of their family (which seems like a compulsion) to compensate for the fact that my reaction was not appropriate.\n\nI have already seen a therapist because I have many other OCD themes (Pure O)   but for some thoughts, I don't know when a thought is 'mine' and therefore my reaction to them is not compulsion, or when it is OCD.

She was starving and freezing. \n\nWe have her in our bathroom right now and plan on keeping her as long as vet gives her all clear to interact and be around our cat. \n\nWell we held up both cats to see each other without letting them touch and my original cat started hissing and getting upset.

I\u2019m 18(F) and currently with my LDR boyfriend 19(M); we\u2019ve been together for a little over four months. \n\nI have been feeling so awful recently. I\u2019ve had a lot of doubts and worries about my relationship with him, especially since it\u2019s once in a blue moon that I experience sexual attraction toward him. This whole fiasco of my low libido started when we were watching porn together, and I found myself to be more turned on by lesbian porn rather than heterosexual porn, leading to my OCD latching onto my sexual orientation. And it just kept getting bigger and more tumultuous.\n\nI\u2019ve had these thoughts before that, and I\u2019m very communicative with my boyfriend about my OCD, though I tend to feel awful sharing things regarding our relationship because it\u2019s always negative. Like, what if he\u2019s not the one? What if I\u2019m really limiting myself from exploring like my mom said? Am I making a bad choice by staying with him and denying myself pleasure? Things like that. I even suggested breaking up because I was like, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have to deal with my issues. I need to go.\u201d \n\nMy boyfriend has been so good to me. He\u2019s been nothing but sweet, supportive, loyal, and compassionate\u2014his whole personality is just amazing, and I do find him physically attractive, my libido is just. Not there? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m hoping it comes back when the winter recedes. \n\nI\u2019m in therapy and take medication for my OCD. They both said to wait until I actually see him in person to see if I\u2019m truly attracted, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing right now. He probably won\u2019t come to see me until summer 2025 or winter 2025-2026, but I can see myself being more excited sexually with that happening. \n\nI don\u2019t know. I saw a thing where it was like \u201care you staying with him out of love or guilt?\u201d Which led me to go on a rabbit hole. I saw an article about that by Ideapod, and I resonated with almost all of the key points, and now I\u2019m just anxious. Do I feel guilty for leaving since he\u2019s such a nice man who\u2019s so enamored and adamant on marrying me? Who\u2019s shed tears because of me saying, \u201cmaybe we should break up because I\u2019m too mentally unstable for you\u201d? That he\u2019s so determined to make things work? I shouldn\u2019t be with him if I\u2019m not as passionate as he is. Whenever I have these flare ups, he does try to tell me about times where I was like, giggling at his compliments and reading back at old texts between us\u2026 but I don\u2019t know. \n\nI\u2019m so lost. I just want to know if things are going to be okay or not with him. I want to stop worrying about it all, and\u2026 I just want to go back to September where I had the butterflies, and I was carefree and happy to be his girlfriend. Now I\u2019m just shambled by doubt, anxiety, and depression. \n\nI just want things to work out between us like he does. I even fear that I\u2019m taking a toll on him with my mental health issues, but he assures me otherwise. \n\nI just want things to be okay. "

    "content": "So my boyfriend has contamination OCD and tons of health anxiety. I'm struggling to walk the line between being supportive while also not feeding these compulsions more. Some of his tendencies annoy me but are manageable (example, he won't drink out of open containers, won't let me use Windex to clean kitchen counters, won't go to restaurants with specific health code violations, will needlessly toss foods he deems contaminated or expired, won't eat any seafood from a restaurant, etc.). Those ones I figure I can accommodate his requests fairly easily, so I don't make a fuss. (He's never snippy with me about them even if I break a rule. He just calmly says he won't eat that and apologizes). \n\nThe things that do bother me a little more, however, are his health triggers/anxiety. Some fairly innocuous things can send him into a panic spiral. He's had full blown panic attacks  over a little dizziness or stomach cramps, convinced he's poisoned himself with expired almonds and might need a hospital. During these times I try my best to reassure him that he's fine, he doesn't need a hospital, the nuts weren't expired, etc, and he usually calms down after a few minutes.\n\nMy question is, am I handling this correctly? Does OCD require more tough love and less coddling? I do love him. Aside from these OCD tendencies he has been the sweetest, most thoughtful, most communicative and supportive boyfriend I've ever had, but our relationship is still relatively new (six months in) and I worry about his OCD symptoms worsening to a point beyond which I'll be able to help. So I want to give him the best support I can now in the right way. \n\nAny advice is welcomed, thanks so much!"

    "title": "Started ERP therapy, but having difficulty because my obsessions aren't super specific -- I'm just neurotic and overthink a lot. So I don't know what to put down as triggers, and feel like the ones my therapist helped me choose aren't relevant.",
    "content": "Looking for advice on this.\n\nI've had OCD since childhood (now mid-30s), went dormant in my teens, came back with a vengeance in my late 20s.\n\nJust began ERP therapy for the first time after years of no improvement with talk therapy. \n\nThe issue is: The only true daily trigger I have is checking my stovetop before I leave the house. Beyond that, it's more generalized issues -- health anxiety/panic attacks (e.g. convincing myself something is wrong with my health, spiraling, looking for assurance online); contamination fears to an extent, but nothing super specific (more-so I tend to wash my hands immediately if I've handled any kind of chemical cleaner like Lysol, but in theory this isn't really a bad practice).\n\nMost of my OCD tendencies are neurotic over-thinking, rumination, replaying events and plaguing myself with \"what if?\" scenarios, to the point where I'm often unable to live in the moment and enjoy life, because I'm always spiraling about something that has happened or may happen or I think could have happened.\n\nI've *had* specific triggers in the past that fall under these categories, for example an obsessive fear of contracting rabies, or worrying \"what if I hit that person with my car?\"... I told this to my therapist and he put them down as exposures to practice, but after a week, none of them had popped up a single time. I can go *months* without any rabies triggers, but if I'm walking at night and a bat flies over my head, then it comes back. Likewise, the car thing can pop up out of nowhere after months without happening.\n\nHe began talking to me to try and uncover things we could put down, and we came up with about 5 or 6 triggers, but after the session was over I felt like none of the things we chose were really super relevant to me and were lower on my list of OCD symptoms if that makes sense. One of them was doing new exercises at the gym. This is definitely something I can be apprehensive about, but I feel like it's more of a social anxiety thing, and it's not nearly as persistent in my daily life as the general rumination, over-thinking, replaying of events, reassurance-seeking behaviors, etc.\n\n  \nHow can I narrow down my *general* neurotic behaviors into more specific concrete triggers? I'm really struggling with this. I feel like a neurotic, wound-up ball of anxiety and rumination and stress all the time, but unlike many people with OCD, I wouldn't say I have persistent, consistent obsessions and compulsions. It's more of an overall behavioral and mental pattern, where something (anything) can happen and I dwell and overthink and question. As an example, yesterday I had a phone call with someone where I felt like I sounded dumb and unintelligent during the conversation, and made a remark that I think was misinterpreted as an insult to the other person. I kept replaying the conversation in my head afterwards and kicking myself, and then sought reassurance from a friend by telling him what happened. A common feedback I get from family and friends is that I'm overthinking, or need to live in the moment and stop worrying, and that a lot of times the scenarios I create in my head involve a lot of projecting my own assumptions onto the other person. Like, \"They probably thought I insulted them,\" when in reality the other person might not have taken it that way at all.\n\nAnother example is last week there was an issue at work where I spent an inordinate amount of time drafting various emails to my manager because I kept worrying it wouldn't come off exactly how I wanted it to. Spent an hour on something that should have been a couple minutes. \n\nBut these aren't daily situations. They're overarching themes of neuroticism and overthinking, right?\n\nAny suggestions? How can I pursue ERP if I don't have specific triggers and obsessions and all my issues are more generalized?  How can I whittle down these bigger picture themes into specific examples and triggers to practice?"

    "title": "Has anyone else undergone psychiatric misdiagnosis / abuses that deeply reinforced your obsessions and failed to treat your OCD?  How do I heal?",
    "content": "\n\nIt\u2019s a really long story but I\u2019m diagnosed with ptsd adhd ocd, as well as GAD and panic often as a reaction to the intrusive thoughts. \n\nWhen I was younger I went on a trip to a foreign country with traveling buddies to get away from the extreme dysfunction and emotional abuse in my family of origin.   My mom didn\u2019t care that I was gone and my dad became over controlling.  \n\nWhen I came back I was thrown in a psych hospital.   This hospital was bizarre and no one told me what it was so I didn\u2019t know why I could not leave.    This psych unit has since been permanently shut down due to severe neglect and severe abuses of patients.   The therapist was creepy to me.   I was diagnosed with bipolar.   They diagnosed me because of mood swings where I\u2019d wake up happy (hoping I\u2019d get to leave that day) and then go to bed sad (because I was still stuck).\n\nThis was a popular diagnosis to give \u201cmisbehaving\u201d young women back then.  \n\nAnyway so the truth is I was not bipolar and am not.  \n\nThe medications sometimes helped (low dose seroquel helped bc it\u2019s good for ocd and sleep) but often harmed.  Lamictal harmed me because it triggered MASSIVE OCD flares.   They were treated with more lamictal.  \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nTo complicate matters it turns out I do have focal aware epilepsy so anti seizure meds helped with that part of it.  \n\nNo one cared for years about my ocd struggles.  It was treated as literally \u201cwell those thoughts aren\u2019t useful so dismiss them.  Here\u2019s more lamictal and don\u2019t stop it bc you\u2019ll lose your mind and go insane.\u201d\n\nSince then I\u2019ve had neurology diagnosis my seizures and get me off lamictal and on a better one for me. \n\nHowever the OCD and anxiety are still there. Not as bad as on lamictal but not cured.  \n\nit\u2019s been a huge struggle because in my formative years entire institutions and doctors reinforced to me over and over that I was bipolar, I was in danger at any moment of becoming manic and psychotic, that I was going to lose control at any moment and not even be aware I was losing control.  \n\nI developed worsening obsessions about going crazy like this.  \n\nObviously this is kind of a terrible thing to tell someone with ocd.   My ocd is in many sub categories but going crazy without realizing it is a huge one. \n\nI used to just avoid working on any of my hobbies or projects or career ambitions because that would mean I was \u201cshowing signs of mania like increased focus on projects and goals.\u201d I\u2019d be afraid to go on trips.  I\u2019d be afraid to get into a groove of cleaning up my house because that also meant I might become manic.   Almost anything productive was terrifying to me.   I\u2019d be afraid to even move. \n\nSo see the problem?   By getting a misdiagnosis from a big formidable institution, which doctors then kept reinforcing by treating me like a ticking time bomb and prescribing more of the wrong meds for years while telling me that if I took an SSRI I\u2019d be in GRAVE DANGER and GO INSANE  and it would be TOO LATE, while utterly ignoring my OCD and not listening to my symptoms or just shaming them, I had a lot of very credentialed people reinforce my worst obsessions.  Over and over.  And I experienced REAL consequences like being locked up.  \n\n\nI want to be clear I NEVER had a formal evaluation for bipolar.   I just had the one quack now closed psych ward diagnose me based on how I acted a couple of days.    I NEVER had another evaluation, drs just let the first diagnosis mark me forever and were scared to mess with my meds.   The one psych who knew me really well didn\u2019t believe I was bipolar and had me on lexapro.  But he retired.  \n\nI\u2019m grown and have my own family now and I\u2019ve been on a journey.   I went off lamictal, with my old psych acting like I was going to literally lose my humanity and become insane for doing this.   I fired her and sought therapy.    I got the neuro to finally test and diagnose my epilepsy.    My therapist met with me for 2 years and said I have ptsd and adhd and not bipolar.   I also have a new psych who also believes I have PTSD anxiety ocd and adhd and not bipolar.  \n\nWe\u2019re working on an ssri but I have difficult side effects AND I tend to quit them because you guessed it, the initial activation scared me really badly and I become terrified of becoming manic and losing control and not being aware of it.  \n\nI had a second therapist after my first one moved who had also told me I don\u2019t have bipolar. \n\nI\u2019m seeking an OCD therapist right now just in the process.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m trying to find an antidepressant to help me as well.  Zoloft helped my ocd a lot but I had some physical health issues with it and stopped.  We\u2019re still working on it, it\u2019s tricky. \n\nBut yeah idk what the point of this is, it just hit me that of course I\u2019m terrified to treat my ocd.  For 18+ years and in my formative years I was told, by very official people and places, over and over, the WORST possible thing for my ocd.  That I was an unstable bad person because I went on a trip and i could at any time lose control and not know I\u2019m insane.  And they told me under no circumstances could I take the exact medication that is for OCD, all while ignoring my real pain from OCD. \n\nIt took me years to even hear of ocd besides \u201cneat freak\u201d cliche (not me) and then a year before I had the courage to try an ssri. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that I have some family who probably are bipolar and they would reinforce (if I was ever happy or excited they\u2019d say I was getting manic) but I also have family history of anxiety and ocd that again no one cared about?  \n\nIt just hit me tonight like no wonder I\u2019m terrified to stick with my meds and always quit them too early.  No wonder I\u2019m terrified of ERP.   The people who were supposed to help me told me the most harmful thing they could.    Of course I\u2019m terrified of anything that will teach me to relax and ignore the obsessions instead of clamping down on them.  \n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong I believe my current doctors.  Even back then, once I got home, I had a psych who was extremely skeptical of the diagnosis and took me off a lot of the meds.  And was fine with my taking lexapro.   This all got complicated by the fact that I have a seizure disorder so sometimes the bipolar seizure meds \u201chelped\u201d because they were controlling that.  They just didn\u2019t help the ocd. \n\nPhew.  I just needed to talk about this.  Idk if anyone else had ever been harmed by a misdiagnosis.   I\u2019d be afraid to try anything at all or get anything done because of fear of mania.  Of course I\u2019m scared when I had all these doctors and institutions reinforcing the wrong thing just because of one bad diagnosis.   \n\nIt was like anti ERP therapy.   Like instead of saying no you aren\u2019t going to lose control, the doctors told me yes you are going to lose control and you won\u2019t even know it \ud83d\ude2d \n\nIt\u2019s so ingrained that I\u2019ll even convince myself that my current doctors are just saying what I want to hear to keep me as a patient. That they don\u2019t know I\u2019m secretly bipolar.   It doesn\u2019t matter I\u2019m not on any bipolar meds (except low dose seroquel not a bipolar dose) and haven\u2019t gone manic.    I would be afraid that if I wanted to go out of the house for a short drive and get ice cream that it\u2019s mania.   Anything beyond zombie makes me afraid of mania.   \n\nThe worst part is I suffered on the wrong meds for years bc I thought I was being good by obeying the doctor.  And now my doctor is telling me to stick with my SSRISs and I am afraid to listen because of my past experiences. NB:  more than once the wrong psych med landed me in the er and once in the icu so that\u2019s another fear.   \n\nI\u2019m seeking an ocd therapist I just needed to talk about this.   Like what an awful thing to tell someone with OCD.   Now I have to overcome so much of that programming.  "

They hold me to the same standards they did when I was a gifted kid.

I could probably try harder but when I tried cbt or erp in the past I had severe, long-lasting panic attacks that resulted in severe self-harm.\n\nI had a lifelong dream of making art for a living but every brush stroke/pencil stroke takes minutes bc I have to go over it again and again.\n\nIn a few months my family are moving to Europe for my brother's career, and they're going to leave me behind bc they don't want to deal with me anymore, so I'll basically be homeless.

He has had OCD since before I was born, and since my mom divorced him, I\u2018m the only person here to support him. \n\nHis OCD is mostly dirt/germ related. It\u2018s triggered by big transporters, people in (physical) work clothes and anything that has to do with his place of work (a factory). Everything in that factory is dirty for him and so of course is he when he comes home. He has a seperate car only used for deiving to and from work, he has a seperate laundry basket only for workclothes, the living room couch is only used by him bc I may make it dirty and so on. He also has lots and lots of thoughts and may think of one specific thing he may have done wrong or where sth might have gotten dirty for hours on end.\n\nHis biggest struggle is showering after work. On a bad day he showers super long because he keeps forgetting if something is already washed or not. It works best when I\u2018m in the room (the open door thankfully blocks my view but it\u2018s enough for him to know i\u2018m here) but of course, I\u2018m young, I have a boyfriend and since my dad obviously does not like outside people in the house (dirty) I spend a lot of nights away from home. But because I know how much of a struggle this causes for my dad, I worry constantly. \n\nSo I really just want to ask for advice on how I can support him? There is a doctor looking over him even though his medication doesn\u2018t really seem to help and he refuses therapy bc it\u2018s \u201ea waste of time and money\u201c and he\u2018s sceptical if it would even help at all. Since he only doesn\u2018t trust himself but trusts others he tends to just ask me watch him wash his hands or do any \u201edirty work\u201c around the house. His car anxiety is basically gone because we bought a dashcam and now \u201esomeone else\u201c aka the camera sees everything and can confirm nothing got dirty in the process of driving. May this be an option for the bathroom too?\n\nIs there anything else I can do to support him? I really am on my own here since he also has no friends bc of how severe his condition is and he\u2019s depressed as well. Sorry if this all is confusing, I tried to be as concise as possible. \nI\u2018m thankful for any advice at all!"

I pay into a pension through work. At the moment I have 42K in Credit Union savings. I tend to have around 200 euro left in my account each month for \u201cfun\u201d spending. Also spend 35pm on gym membership. I try to keep 8k in my normal bank account and not go below that (don\u2019t know the reason but maybe something psychological). My big goal is to work towards getting my own place (I share with one other person at the moment and I can\u2019t stand living with others and working around their habits) - Ideally I\u2019d like to get my own apartment in Dublin.  I really like Dublin like going for drives out to the Dublin/Wicklow Mountains. With my current savings, salary and the fact I\u2019m single it\u2019s hard to realize this goal. \n\nSometimes I feel like I\u2019m not living life fully - Don\u2019t get me wrong I do go out but it\u2019s mainly with colleagues which is rare and the one or two other friends I have in Dublin. But I do want to take up other activities like joining a tennis club (local tennis club being 300 Per year), join a cycle club (need to upgrade my bike) and maybe Yoga I was thinking. The positive of doing these is that I will be meeting people - Maybe potential flatmates, a partner or just like minded people). The downside is that I\u2019d probably need to eat into my Credit Union savings and impact my ability to find get my own place. Also considering I\u2019ll need to upgrade my laptop soon enough. Maybe part of the problem is that I put money into Credit Union without a defined goal other than to hopefully have a place of my own. \n\nHow should I deal with the anxiety that\u2019s preventing me doing things like joining the tennis club, buying a new bike and joining the club etc.? I feel so restricted especially around buying \u201cwants\u201d/doing things that would provide all the benefits of meeting new people, just feels like I\u2019m not fully \u201cliving\u201d sometimes. \n\nSometimes I feel like I should make a strong effort to find a new job to get a salary raise but I feel like I need to address the situation with the housing situation because sharing with others I find very draining. How would I cope with a new job when the home situation is so difficult? I\u2019m only subletting to him but thing is I could get someone that\u2019s worse too - Probably more down to the fact that I like my own space (although I know that\u2019s a luxury in today\u2019s environment.)"

Okay backstory is that I have been friends with this girl for around a year and a half. I had a crush on her shortly after we became friends and have since. We are super close and have told each other that we\u2019ve never felt as close of a friendship to anyone else in our lives. On Christmas we had a sleepover and when we were laying in bed we started kissing. I was overjoyed because I thought she must like me back right? Well the next morning after she left we were texting and I told her about my feelings and how I\u2019d been hiding them from her for over a year. And she said something along the lines of not really thinking the kissing was romantic but more of a way to show how deep our connection was. Also just to throw it out there we are both Christian. She said she didn\u2019t know how she felt because the idea had never even occurred to her just that it didn\u2019t feel wrong or sinful in the moment because it felt like it came from a place of love. She then goes on to say that it doesn\u2019t feel like how her crushes on guys have felt so she doesn\u2019t think that it\u2019s romantic. Then I have her over New Year\u2019s Eve. And the same thing happens she sleeps over and we kiss in bed. We wake up and it\u2019s a great day but we don\u2019t talk about it other than me telling her it doesn\u2019t have to mean anything unless she wants it to.  For the next couple of weeks whenever we have a sleepover the same thing happens and she says that maybe she is feeling something for me but isn\u2019t really sure. Also for context she has pretty bad OCD and so her mind can convince her of anything like feeling something she doesn\u2019t or that she\u2019s not feeling anything. This makes the situation even harder. Okay so this weekend we had three sleepovers and each one ended with us kissing in bed. Then the day after our last sleepover we kissed more and afterwards she seemed really off. I asked her if she was okay but she just said she felt nauseous. And then today she texted me: It didn't feel so wrong before but yesterday I felt so guilty and wrong and I think it's because I knew in my gut. It was never doing it that made me feel sick it was what it meant I was doing to you if I didn't feel that way. And then I asked her if she felt anything and she said that she thinks she only feels friendship but it could just be her mind. I feel so confused and heartbroken right now. She is my best friend and I have no one to turn to talk about this to. I just need some advice on what to do. She is so important to me I want her in the rest of my life even if it\u2019s just as friends. I really did fall in love with her though I shouldn\u2019t have gotten my hopes up because now I\u2019m truly crushed. \n\nTL;DR\nI\u2019m (F17) in love with my best friend (F17) and we\u2019ve been kissing lately. She said she doesn\u2019t feel romantically towards me and I\u2019m crushed and don\u2019t know what to do"

Every time I see her it comes back and I have to walk away. I'm so scared of hurting her. And I've heard it from other people that when you have a \"reason\" for harm your, hanr ocd goes rampant. But I don't know what to do. I don't know how to make it stop and I feel so scared that I'm going to hurt my mom. I need advice. "

Basically I have dealt with emetophobia almost my entire life, but as of this summer that has extended to fear of diarrhea/bowel changes and what they could mean. Am I sick? Do I have cancer? Will I have an accident? What if things worsen and I need to be hospitalized? Etc etc etc etc.\nI spend every day hyper aware of every sensation in my bowel and panicking before bowel movements. All this stress is obviously not good for my bowels. I also have food intolerances which can cause upset if I indulge.\n\nMy day depends on the quality of my bowel movements. Anything weird or off makes me spiral.\nI feel so dirty and ashamed that one of my compulsions is, um, physically checking myself to see if any stool is left after a movement and uhhh removing it. Or checking even if I am gassy. I have yet to mention this to my therapist as I\u2019m so ashamed about it.\n\nDoes anyone else relate?  I feel so alone and uncomfortable.

Since I was a child, I\u2019ve had pure OCD with very strong compulsions and magical thinking, as well as health anxiety that has been with me my whole life. At some point, this was also joined by DPDR in episodes. This is how I spent part of my childhood and adolescence, with irrational fears that blocked me and didn\u2019t let me be a normal kid. I missed out on camps, trips, outings with friends, and suffered from stress almost daily, but no one knew how to name my suffering\u2014it was a different time (I\u2019m 27 now).\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until a year ago, after a traumatic death and a breakup (which are connected), that my body began to somatize more than ever (though it had already done so before). I experienced palpitations, ectopic beats, dizziness, fatigue, and a kind of flashbacks with very random images. I ended up in the ER several times, but they couldn\u2019t find anything. I underwent a ton of tests while suffering greatly. I felt very disconnected, and my derealization became (once again) constant. On top of that, there were the flashbacks\u2014my body and mind constantly felt like they were dying.\n\nI had to stop living my life and began obsessively searching for answers and solutions. Although I wasn\u2019t very convinced that what was happening to me was mental (health anxiety is a liar), I decided to find a good therapist (I had spent years jumping from one to another, and no one seemed to identify my patterns\u2014it was a waste of money and time). I\u2019ve been working with my current therapist since then, and I\u2019ve improved in many ways. Little by little, I\u2019m resuming my life, but a year and some months have passed, and I\u2019m still struggling with some symptoms and fears.\n\nI\u2019ve been advised to start taking escitalopram, but I don\u2019t dare. My OCD and health anxiety keep finding reasons why it\u2019s a bad idea, but the truth is, living with a mind that goes 3000 km/h and is full of fears and disconnected from reality doesn\u2019t allow me to be the kind of person I believe I am beneath all this tangle of diagnoses.\n\nI don\u2019t want to keep being afraid. Could you help me with your opinion on how you would approach this problem? Would you take the medication? And if anyone has any experiences to share, that would also be great.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the long text. I hope you all have a wonderful day, and thank you so much for reading this, from the bottom of my heart. "

Recently, my (now ex) gf and I decided to stop talking to each other, and I am really trying to figure myself and life out. I have always had some anxiety and depression going on since high school, but never talked to a doctor or gotten prescribed. It never felt right and I felt stigmatized by the situation. After reading and listening to some podcasts about OCD, something feels like it clicked and now I really want to explore this and try to make myself feel normal. Im scared to try a psychologist, and very hesitant for medication, and Im tearing up right now because I just want to be a normal guy with a normal head, but I understand that might not ever happen if I don\u2019t try something I guess. I just have a couple questions.\n\n1. Should I try a psychologist or therapist? Finding someone decent around KCMO has proven challenging as I don\u2019t know what im looking for. I feel like they all specialize in one niche but from what I have figured out I fit into Health, Harm, Relationship, Sexual, SO-OCD, POCD, specific compulsions, anxiety, and depression. It seems like large order but money is tight and I cant be seeing 20 people unfortunately.\n\n2. I thought about hitting this at 2 angles, look into OCD and talk to a Relationship Counselor. Idk if my relationship doubts and problems are caused by OCD though. Should I look into OCD first and then the Counseling? Or do both?\n\n3. I just read a similar comparison on Reddit, here is my own perspective. I have thought/said for years, since I was in High School - it feels like there are 2 parts of my brain. The normal, rational side that thinks average, normal human thoughts but it feels smaller and in less control. Then there is the irrational, nasty part of my brain that constantly ruminates and obsesses over weird, negative, and stressful stuff. It feels like this side is a giant and bullies the rational side into submission. Is this the case with most people?"

Without going into details, the main theme is that I need to be in the correct \"space\" of time after having done a specific ritual in order to watch or listen to discs I've bought (Blu-ray, DVD, CD) and sometimes to use electronics I bought.  The problem is that this ritual is so complex and I never do it to my satisfaction, which means I'm never in that \"space\" . . . which means I never feel it's the right time to play these movies/albums or read some books.  I have some discs I've bought close to ten years ago that I have not watched in full.  I bought a new CD player in 2020, but didn't use it until 2022.  I watch other movies of course, such as ones I rent, but the ones I buy, I have these issues about.\n\nSo sometimes I'll buy a movie, open it, but not watch the whole thing.  This is currently a problem because many of those movies are from David Lynch, my favorite director who just passed.  I've viewed all his movies of course, but these are new editions on BD, and some CDs that he did or books he wrote, that I have not listened to or read in full.  I wanted to get to a big watchathon and really get back into his world, and of course wanted to do it while he was alive.  But my rules caused me to procrastinate so much that I have all this stuff sitting that I haven't watched, and I feel forlorn about it because he isn't around.  I also have movies from directors like Carpenter, Craven, Romero, and Cronenberg which I haven't watched (I have viewed the movies, just not these discs).  \n\nI had it in my mind that with my OCD rituals I was working towards a point that I'd have a huge watchathon that would be fun with all this stuff.  In fact, when I rented my first free-standing house almost three years ago, a big thing that was exciting is that I wouldn't need to be concerned about having an apartment neighbor to bother with volume and such, and could just watch as I liked.  I was thinking I'd dig into the special features like commentaries as well.  But my damn OCD has kept me from it, and at this point I have very little enthusiasm for any of it."

    "title": "need advice from anyone who is diagnosed with both OCD and bipolar!",
    "content": "I\u2019ve been diagnosed with OCD and lately, I\u2019ve been suspicious of me having some sort of bipolar disorder. I remember a few years ago during therapy, my therapist recommended I get evaluated for a mild form of bipolar disorder because she said it\u2019s definitely not type 1, based on what I was telling her and she did say I might or might not so it was best to get evaluated for it but well\u2026 I basically just ignored her recommendation.\n\nFast forward 2 years later, I\u2019ve been wondering if I should get evaluated just to see if I do or don\u2019t have it after a talk I had with my partner. I\u2019ve been doing research on hypomania and from what I took is that some people who are in an hypomania episode get into various things. Some things that I read that I ALSO do is making impulsive purchases. I\u2019m a part time worker and a college student so I definitely don\u2019t have the means to drop $300 in one day or $500 within a span of 2-3 days. I also tend to have days where I get \u201ccreative\u201d or have lots of ideas like of a sudden I have a great grand business plan and I\u2019m doing deep dives n research on it for hours on end and/or days, sometimes I will stay up almost all night. I will type up a google doc and start curating plans on the prices and how much of a loan I would need or save up. I\u2019m emailing and looking through manufactures and contacting them, even texting them back and forth trying to create a quote and measurements. Like I\u2019m a business woman all of a sudden then boom it wears out and I will never open the doc or note ever again or up until the next \u201cepisode.\u201d\n\nJust this month, I was making up plans on buying real estate in another country (my motherland) and contacting the real estate agents for quotes and information on property taxes, fees, etc. I was already calculating how much I would be making if I flipped it into a rental/airbnb property and going into details. I was REALLY borderline convinced that I could flip the property into an airbnb and afford paying the mortgage and the monthly fees for the rest of my life. Mind you I only turned 19 years old a few months ago and once again, I\u2019m a part time worker who only makes around $600 a month\u2026 \ud83d\ude2d then after a few days, its like I never spent hours and hours and even restless night or two trying to plan up this project. Like it never crossed my mind ever again.\n\nThere\u2019s a few times where I would also get into meal planning for the gym and buy a whole bunch of food and start jotting down hm calories/protein I would get and create an every day meal plan. I would do this even tho I dont even go to the gym but I would convince myself and be so optimistic that I would start the next day but then never touch any of the groceries I bought and I\u2019m now unmotivated and don\u2019t care enough for it so it would just be left rotting or my family would have no choice but to eat or make something out of it so it doesnt go to waste.\n\nI mention these because I always just thought these are normal OR part of my OCD. Does that sound about right? I definitely have other things I can think of that I suspect are hypomania episodes but the ones I mentioned are just some that I\u2019m questioning whether if its actually OCD or not. I recently started questioning it because I get so obsessed with whatever Ideas or business plan or etc I come up with and from what I understand with OCD, is that nobody really likes to do any of their compulsions and obsessions. And with the things I mentioned up above, I\u2019m not obsessed in a way that makes me feel bad but in a way that makes me feel really good about myself and life. I read a comment regarding bipolar disorder as well and how they explained it clicks with me, they said something about not even being happy during a state of hypomania but instead having a strong feeling of ambition and blind optimism and that\u2019s exactly how I would describe it as well. Its like nothing can go wrong.\n\nI\u2019m very confused whether the events I said aligns more with my OCD or something else and if those r signs that are worth trying to get evaluated for. I know nobody can diagnose me and I WILL get an appointment set up with a psychiatrist soon but I was just wondering if theres any insight on that and if other people who deal with OCD and Bipolar deals with the same or something similar?"

    "content": "The Operation\n\n\u201cOne more exit, should be exit 67 onto Shady Grove Parkway. Then it\u2019s not far. Not far at all.\u201d She took her gaze off of the road and gave him a brief smile. One of those flashes of smile that\u2019s more gesture than smile. \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m excited. I mean\u2026\u201d he paused. \u201cYeah, actually, I\u2019m nervous. Who wouldn\u2019t be, I guess? People are always nervous before operations, right? But it\u2019s just jitters. Like I used to get before baseball games and stuff like that.\u201d \n\n\u201cI know.\u201d She knew. \n\nHe looked right at the cement wall lining the highway as far as he could see. Behind it the tangles of branches and summer evergreens grew denser and wilder the further he gazed.\n\nHe said, \u201cHey, when we get there, before they give us all of the paperwork and hook me up to a bunch of machines, you think I could give him a call? I owe him that.\u201d\n\nShe turned her attention back to the road and became taut. She was a taut thing now. The car started to move jerkily. Every flexion of her bicep was a meter or so of swerve. The Ford Bronco behind them honked and she loosened slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing he could do to stop it now. I could at least give him the courtesy\u2013\u201d She turned to face him and said nothing, just let the pleading in her eyes fight on her behalf. They said let it go. Please. He noticed the dark bags under her eyes for the first time. Three-pronged creases at their corners too. He found noticing things like that hard. Material things. Things in the here and now. His concepts and thoughts and thinking were always vying for that commodity of attention.\n\nThey were quiet for a while.\n\n \u201cFuck!\u201d She\u2019d missed the exit. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be late. That\u2019s fine. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s like restaurants. Fifteen-minute grace period.\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah like restaurants,\u201d he said, but it came out a sort of mumble, and he thought that this was really nothing like going to a restaurant. He took a couple of deep breaths. He\u2019d seen something about box breathing online, how the marines did it and how it was supposed to help with anxiety when they had to jump out of planes or kick down doors. He\u2019d never really felt it work, but he liked the idea that he had something to try if he ever had to jump out of a plane or kick down a door or ask his girlfriend a question. \n\n\u201cWhat if I\u2019m not the same after? I mean, of course, I won\u2019t be the same. That\u2019s the point. But what if some of the good parts of me are gone too. What if this thing is too much of who I am to just get rid of without changing everything else.\u201d \n\nShe took her eyes off the road again and gave him a puzzled look. She meant it to be reassuring, but it felt condescending. He hoped that she would miss another exit while looking at him. He turned away as she spoke.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works. We\u2019ve done the research. Months of it. It\u2019s like when you have a mole and they say it might be cathartic\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cCarcinogenic.\u201d He tapped two fingers on the dashboard six times. \n\nShe continued, \u201c...Carcinogenic. You have to remove it and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s gone and you\u2019re you and it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t seem right either. This wasn\u2019t a mole being removed at a restaurant. What type of restaurant would remove moles? \n\n\u201cOkay, but say I am different. Maybe a lot of my issues are gone like that,\u201d He snapped his fingers. He snapped a second time. \u201cBut a part of me is gone also. Maybe it\u2019s just 5%. Maybe my sense of humor is a little bit different or my golf swing changes. Maybe it\u2019s not a bad change, but I change. That means we change. Like how one electron peels off and you have a new atom. What if you don\u2019t love the new version as much?\u201d \n\nShe paused for a moment. He appreciated that. She\u2019d become so used to reassuring him that she usually did so without considering his fears. Sitting with them like he felt he had to.\n\n\u201cMaybe you do change,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you will. These are real professionals. But maybe you change, and we change. I mean. I\u2019m trying to stop from reassuring you because I know that\u2019s not how I\u2019m supposed to handle it. You have to be okay with that possibility, and if you\u2019re not then I won\u2019t make you go forward. I want you to but I won\u2019t make you.\u201d She looked over from the road and this time she had a dimple between her eyebrows and there was steely conviction in her eyes, \u201cBut can you really go on suffering like this? Aren\u2019t you exhausted? I mean. I\u2019m sorry honey. I love you and I\u2019ll go on helping you forever if I have to, but I\u2019m tired.\u201d \n\nHe brought his hand across the center console and reached for hers. They locked fingers and he understood this was for her as much as him. She had always been his ally, but he knew he couldn\u2019t expect her to push on forever. Everything is transactional past a certain point, even love. She gave his hand a squeeze. \n\nHe decided that was enough reassurance for now and returned his gaze to the bug-stained window of their Camry. Outside, the cement wall along the highway was eroding, a tangle of vines running along it like spider webs. He counted each wall as they passed, each marked by a tapping together of his canines so that his jaw moved side to side in near-perfect rhythm. The Autumnal foliage drew his eyes up, brilliant hues of red, orange, and yellow. His gaze turned left and he saw a sign reading exit 66. \n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say we passed exit 67 already? I think that sign just said 66.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t think so. We just passed 68. We have to exit at 69 now to get back on the parkway heading south. Shouldn\u2019t add too much time to the trip provided this asshole semi-truck lets me pass.\u201d He saw her right leg advance as their four-cylinder engine rose from a purr to a hum. He decided that she must be right. \n\nHe thought that he should call Alex when he gets there. He could excuse himself to use the restroom as soon as they entered the facility. He would call Alex in the bathroom and explain everything. He would understand and then he could get the procedure and everything would be fine; everything would be fine. If not, then\u2026 well, then he would figure that out. Maybe he\u2019d plan some sort of escape with Alex. They used to play spy with Nerf guns when they were little, they had plenty of practice with that sort of thing.\n\nThe car slowed, yanking him from the lull of his rabbit hole. Every time it felt the same, like waking from a dream, confusion into annoyance into something like calm, however brief. \u201cFinally exiting,\u201d she said, still too chipper for his liking. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have to get back on the freeway after all. I used to have soccer here and my mom would always take the back way past Shady Grove.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure? Maybe we should just follow the navigation.\u201d \n\n\u201cPositive.\u201d She said, the cheeriness in her voice giving way to impatience. They found themselves along an empty two-lane road. The leafless trees surrounded them on both sides and met above, a dense cocoon of decaying branch and twig. Behind them the sun was falling. \n\n\u201cHoney, I don\u2019t mean to question you, but are you sure we should be taking this way? It\u2019ll be dark soon and if we hop on the freeway it should only be a couple more minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to play your games.\u201d Her voice was sharp now. \u201cYou can\u2019t get that from me. Eventually, everything is a leap of faith.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t that. I mean, this is real. I don\u2019t think we should go this way. It\u2019ll be dark soon and there isn\u2019t a car in sight.\u201d She turned to him again, her bright blue eyes vibrated amidst a tangle of red blood vessels. A single tear streaked down her cheek, and its asymmetry irked something in him. \n\n\u201cPlease honey, I have to do this.\u201d She let out through gritted teeth. \n\n\u201cDo what?\u201d He pleaded. She pulled her stare from him to the road and accelerated. He watched the speedometer rise in passive acceptance. \n\n50\u201360\u201370\u201380\u201390\u2013100\u2013110\u2026 \n\nIn his head he did quick addition. 50, 110, 180, 260, 350, 450, 560. \n\nHe closed his eyes and repeated it again and again. There was nothing left but the numbers. \n\n50 110 180 260 350 450 560 \n\n50110180260350450560 \n\n50110180260350450560\n\n5011018026035045\u2013\u2014 \n\nHe opened his eyes, puzzled to find that the car had come to a stop. He turned to his left but she was gone. He supposed she\u2019d had enough. Everyone does, after enough time. He rubbed the spot on the center console where she\u2019d held his hand. He was grateful, nonetheless. It\u2019s a good thing to suffer with someone, even if you have to give up. \n\nHe looked up to see that he was in a parking lot. In front of him a facility whose sign read: McNamara Neurosurgery Center. Night had fallen, and the streetlights dotting the lot revealed only a few other cars, so far in the opposite corner of the lot that he couldn\u2019t decipher any of their makes. Not knowing quite what else to do, he dialed a number on his phone and hit call. He heard Alex pick up.\n\n\u201cJimmy?\u201d There was sleep and maybe whiskey in his voice. \n\n\u201cUh, hi Alex. It\u2019s me. Listen, I\u2019m sorry for bothering you. I know we didn\u2019t see eye to eye the last time we talked. But, um... but,\u201d his voice caught in his throat and he found himself choking up. He was twelve years old again, and all the fear in the world was crashing down on him. \u201cWell I\u2019m really scared right now and I could use my big brother.\u201d \n\nHe heard a grunt on the other side of the phone and waited to be reprimanded. \u201cOf course Jimmy, what is it?\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the procedure. I know you were against it, but, well, but I\u2019m here right now, and I\u2019m confused. I don\u2019t know where Jackie went, and\u2026 and I don\u2019t know if I should walk through that door or not.\u201d \n\nThere was a long pause, and he wondered if Alex had set his phone down and gone back to bed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Jimmy. I know how difficult this must be for you. I never meant to make it harder. I\u2019m scared too,\u201d Alex said.\n\n\u201cOf what?\u201d \n\n\u201cThat I\u2019ll lose my brother from this. That I\u2019ll have to start again with a stranger.\u201d\n\nJimmy thought about offering some sort of reassurance, then changed his mind. His brother\u2019s fears were his own, and he\u2019d never found himself particularly convincing. \n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m scared too,\u201d Jimmy said. No sooner had he said it than he broke into long, deep sobs. Something in them felt good like a pressurized can had just popped in him. \u201cBut what if I\u2019d rather be a stranger? What if I don\u2019t wanna be me anymore?\u201d \n\nHe heard Alex take a deep breath on the other line. \n\n\u201cDid I ever tell you about the first time I realized your brain worked differently?\u201d Alex said.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Jimmy choked out. \n\n\u201cYou were pretty sick. I think it was second grade. Staying home from school. Mom was really worried, and I would come in to check on you at night. A day or two later you felt better and went back to school, and wouldn\u2019t you know it I\u2019m sick now. Whatever you caught had a real grudge against me, cause it knocked me out for a full week.\u201d Alex chuckled at this. \u201cAnd every night you would come into my room, and tell me how sorry you were, and that you never meant to get me sick. You would bring me medicine and put a cold towel on my forehead, you\u2019d even clean up my puke. Mom got annoyed that you were doing her job for her.\u201d Again, he chuckled. \u201cAnd then I got better, of course, and life went back to normal.\u201d Jimmy couldn\u2019t remember any of this. \u201cBut not for you. You spent an hour washing your hands raw every night. And any time either I or mom got sick after that, I would hear you praying in your room for hours.\u201d\n\nJimmy said nothing in reply, he just let the tears roll slowly down his cheek. He tended not to think about those days. \n\nAlex continued, \u201cWhat happened was completely dysfunctional. I had to watch my little brother go to war with himself for years, while he should\u2019ve been going to dances, having his first kiss, making mistakes, living his life. I prayed, more than once, that we could trade places.\u201d Jimmy heard static coming through the line, cutting through his brother\u2019s voice for a few seconds. \n\n\u201cBut the way your mind works also made you kind, empathetic, clever, and smarter than I\u2019ll ever be. It made you, you. So, selfishly, I don\u2019t wanna say goodbye to that person. And frankly, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m gonna get along with this new guy.\u201d Jimmy heard a sniffle on the other side of the phone. \u201cBut you of all people don\u2019t deserve to be you. That\u2019s a cross you shouldn\u2019t have to bear.\u201d The sniffles had escalated to poorly stifled sobs. \u201cGoodbye, little brother. I love you.\u201d The static returned louder this time, masking his brother\u2019s voice under its signal. \n\n\u201cWait! But, but I haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d His vision began fading, shadow filling the periphery, a growing ring of darkness. The lights of the facility grew blurry, and he felt like he might drop the phone as his limbs went weak and numb. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you have. You just forgot.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d \n\n\t\u201cScalpel?\u201d Came a commanding but distant voice.\n\n\t\u201cScalpel.\u201d Returned a voice less commanding and less distant.\n\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s responding well so far. Limited inflammation or bleeding around the sight of incision. His heart rate spiked two minutes ago but we can probably chalk that up to overstimulation of the brain while forming new neural connections.\u201d\n\n\t\u201cAh mm hmm.\u201d A few voices cooed in agreement.\n\n\t\u201cNow, what say we test the results of our hard work?\u201d The voice said, and Jimmy felt a cold instrument prodding what felt like exposed brain.\n\n\tThen Jimmy is ten years old, watching television at his friend Christopher\u2019s house. It\u2019s a rental they\u2019ve only been living in for a year; it smells of cleaning spray and discount furniture. They\u2019re on the couch, and Jimmy turns to look out through the half-open blinds, revealing a dreary gray day outside. He didn\u2019t decide to turn his head. He was simply a passenger.\n\n\tThey\u2019re watching Ghost Adventures and a too-skinny man with horn-rimmed glasses and a goatee is explaining the grisly backstory of the haunted property they\u2019re set to spend the night in. He explains in detail how a Kansas family left to go to Church and how an ax murderer snuck into their attic while they were out. He explains, in further, more detailed detail, how they all came home and went to bed, and how the ax murderer went on to do what ax murderers do. The whole time explaining it he has this boyish grin. The crew goes into the house, but Jimmy isn\u2019t paying much attention anymore. He stares off and waits to be picked up by his mother.\n\n\tThat night his mother puts him down to bed, and he lays there, unmoving. His eyes are fixed on the closet five feet away. He has to open it. He knows there\u2019s no one in there, but knowing is different than knowing. He stares and stares, and the hours pass by. And he never opens the closet. The concession is never made. No inch is given. No mile taken.\n\nThen he\u2019s on the road again. Looking to his left he sees her.\n\n\u201cWha\u2013 what\u2019s\u2026 where am I?\u201d \n\n\u201cShh don\u2019t stir around too much. The doctors said you would be very sensitive to movement and light when you first wake up.\u201d \n\n\u201cWake up? You mean\u2026 the procedure? Is it over?\u201d \n\n\u201cThey said you might be foggy but I didn\u2019t expect it to be this severe. Doctor Cameron said it went incredibly well. This is great news, honey.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut\u2026 but you were gone, and I was alone at the facility, and Alex. I talked to Alex.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, take a deep breath. You\u2019re on a lot of narcotics, and you aren\u2019t thinking straight. The surgery went well. We\u2019re heading home. That\u2019s all that matters for now.\u201d He noticed his heart was pounding and tried to do his box breathing. \n\nIn\u2026Hold\u2026Out\u2026Hold\u2026In\u2026Hold\u2026Out\u2026Hold \n\nHe let himself steady, reacquainting himself with the interior of the Camry, the rhythm of the freeway flying past. He sat like that for a long time. \n\nFinally, she broke the silence. \u201cDon\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t feel any different. The doctors said it might not be noticeable right away. But, do you feel any\u2026 different?\u201d He found himself mildly annoyed at this but chalked it up to the medley of drugs he was on. \n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019m loopy from the anesthesia.\u201d He tried to look into himself, to find the source of the questioning, the rumination, the fear. Nothing. He was met with a deep and resounding silence. The feeling of absence. He searched past that and found only more silence; darkness. He looked and looked, searched for a head, an observer, a thinker at the center of experience. And there was none, only experience remained, and in this great vacuum, the world flooded in.\n\n\u201cActually, yes. I feel\u2026 I think I feel, ok.\u201d Jim said, a smile pulling up at the corners of his mouth.\n\n"

I got the care I needed but I've been so fucked up since. \nThey sent me off and said oh it'll go away on its own. It took a year of fevers and eating soft food. \nI've been SO fucked up since.

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019ve been dealing with OCD and intrusive thoughts, and I\u2019m feeling incredibly confused and distressed about a situation that\u2019s been playing out during intimate moments. I\u2019m hoping to get some clarity and perspective because the guilt has been overwhelming. Here\u2019s what\u2019s been happening:\n\nDuring intimacy, intrusive thoughts come into my mind. At one point, I was so burnt out and tired of constantly trying to fight them that I let the thoughts linger. My brain kept convincing me that the thought was somehow enhancing my pleasure, so I didn\u2019t immediately push it away. I know now this was a misattribution and likely just my OCD distorting the connection, but in the moment, it felt real.\n\nI think I entertained the thought because I believed it was tied to the physical sensations I was experiencing. I even started testing and comparing how I felt with and without the thought. This back-and-forth left me feeling disconnected from my partner and filled with guilt because it felt like I was giving into something I didn\u2019t actually want.\n\nNow I\u2019m stuck in a cycle of questioning myself and feeling ashamed. I don\u2019t want these thoughts, and I don\u2019t want them to linger, but I can\u2019t shake the guilt that maybe I let them stay because I thought they were making me feel better at the time.\n\nHere are the questions I\u2019m struggling with:\n\n1. **Does letting the thought linger mean I wanted it?**\n   * I didn\u2019t push the thought away immediately because I was burnt out and believed, in the moment, that it might feel good. Does this mean I wanted the thought, or was this just the OCD convincing me of something untrue?\n2. **Is it normal to feel guilt for entertaining the thought briefly?**\n   * I feel horrible for letting the thought stay, even for a short time. Is this guilt common for people with OCD, and how can I work through it?\n3. **Why did I engage in testing and comparing feelings?**\n   * I kept going back and forth, trying to figure out if the thought was really tied to the sensations. Why does OCD make me do this, and how can I break out of the cycle?\n4. **How do I stop misattributing pleasure to intrusive thoughts?**\n   * The sensations felt stronger when I focused on the thought, but I know now it was probably just because I was hyper-focused. How can I stop my mind from making these misattributions in the future?\n5. **How do I move forward without obsessing over what happened?**\n   * The guilt and rumination are consuming me. How do I let go of this and stop questioning myself so much?"

I have multiple diagnosis and to be honest I don't even know what I actually have anymore. I know I have to take pictures of my pills and repeatedly check them before putting them in my mouth and then taking picture of them in my mouth just in case I somehow missed something. I cant seem to take anything else either, even tylenol anymore because of this weird half baked panic that if I take it and I freak out I cant un-take. None of it really makes any sense its just all driven by this horrible feeling inside. The other day I realized I cant change the amount of ice I put in my water bottle. I thought I was doing it because 10 was ideal and now I cant put any more or less in. I cant have any of my cigarettes butts touching in their container..  that ones new. It's annoying the hell out of me because it doesn't even feel like theres a good reason. But the worst is the feeling I get when someone leaves the house, its desperate and it looks like BPD because I also have mood swings its like everything inside me is screaming to do or say anything to stop it from happening.

    "content": "Long post, I\u2019m sorry. \n\nTL;DR\nmy symptoms don\u2019t fit diagnostic criteria for OCD, hoping somebody here my have some insight on abnormal presentation. \n\nSo, I\u2019ve lived with what I now believe to be Harm OCD since I was a teenager, so about 35 years. The thoughts really ramped up post-partum, and died down to a quiet loll after I quit nursing 28 years ago. I\u2019ve spent most of my adult life with the thoughts in the background, not disturbing me. As a teen I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder, and believed it. Of course, I never told anyone about my thoughts of killing my loved ones. Had I, maybe I would\u2019ve gotten a proper dx earlier. \n\nSo, last year I came across a description of harm ocd and knew that was me, except\u2026I don\u2019t have compulsions! Now, hear me out, I don\u2019t have mental compulsions either. The thoughts live there loudly all the time, I don\u2019t fight them, I don\u2019t do reassurance, I don\u2019t count or pray or anything, they\u2019re just there making me anxious. Since hormonal changes in menopause I\u2019ve been having intense anxiety around the thoughts. Which presents like a feeling of weakness, trembling, spacinness, hyper awareness, tiredness, terror, etc. I am now taking hormones and it has helped a lot, but the intrusive thoughts are still very much present.\n\nI went to a therapist who only treats OCD, she uses ERP, ACT, and whatever else she might be trained in. She diagnosed my OCD as sub-clinical, which basically means if I have it,  it\u2019s not fitting the criteria for diagnosis. This is because I don\u2019t have compulsions, or at least none she could find. We did ERP for several months without any improvement. A little hard to do ERP when there\u2019s no compulsions, I thought. But, I went through the hierarchy with zero improvement, in fact, I felt like it got worse because of all the time I was spending thinking about the intrusive thoughts. So, someone suggested that maybe my therapist just wasn\u2019t a fit for me, so I found a different OCD \u201cexpert\u201d, a psychiatrist who also does therapy. again, she confirmed panic disorder and suspects that what I think is OCD is really just the panic disorder. Ironic, because I\u2019ve had only two panic attacks in over 20 years. But the fear of panic attacks is definitely present. \nSo the panic disorder diagnosis does fit.\n\nSo, here\u2019s where I think it\u2019s kindof interesting, maybe, and this is where you can help. What I\u2019m calling a panic attack is really a very intense fear that I\u2019m going to act on my intrusive thoughts of intentionally harming my loved ones. I just go about my day with this intense fear of myself. \n\nMy questions are, is this what OCD is? Can it be OCD if compulsions aren\u2019t present? Alongside these two professionals we\u2019ve assessed for a long list of compulsions and they really aren\u2019t present. Perhaps you see something in this post? \n\nCan a panic attack be the compulsion? Can the intrusive thoughts be the compulsion to a panic attack? \n\nMost important question, What options are there when ERP and ACT don\u2019t help?\n\nare there supplements i should be looking into that might help my brain? \n\nI hate this because my life is great, I don\u2019t have stress or trauma, I don\u2019t have any negative thinking or guilt or \u201cwhat ifs\u201d it\u2019s just these damned unwanted intrusive thoughts that I\u2019m going to lose control and harm my dog, son, mom, kid across the street, etc etc \ud83d\ude2d \n\nAnyways, if this post sounds like I\u2019m seeking reassurance, I\u2019m really not. I think I\u2019m more just wanting opinions or shared experience. It doesn\u2019t feel like panic disorder is the whole picture here, and I\u2019d love to get proper treatment. Thank you for any insight. "

If anyone EVER saw those searches without context, my life would be over immediately. All my friends would leave me and hate me, and I would be the school outcast. I was particularly worried about the people behind me, as my phone screen was likely visible to them.\n\nOne year later, I have a long list of people that I know hate me with a passion. I actively run away from others because I'm paranoid of people calling me out for abhorrent things I simply didn't do. I'm pretty sure nobody wants to talk to me, and one of the people I mentioned in particular always keeps giving me dirty looks. One day he was talking to the people next to me and he says \"what topic are you doing on the assignment? i'm doing mine on the death penalty\" I'm pretty sure he only said that so that I know he wants me dead. Additionally, today I heard him talk about someone being a creep. \n\nI've honestly had it with this piece of shit. You don't have the full context, yet you can't ever keep your mouth shut. You made my own personal mental struggles into a massive spectacle for everyone to see. You speak about me when I'm two feet away from you, I'm not fucking stupid. I hate hearing this loud asswipe's voice every day.\n\nThe problem is that if I try to explain my condition to him, he won't believe that I have OCD, and will probably ruin my life even more. I genuinely see no way that this can be solved other than him somehow leaving school permanently. To be honest, I have been guilty of avoiding him physically as well, out of anxiety. I also can't look him in the eye out of fear.\n\nWell, one positive is that he was probably the only one to see the search, so if I deny the rumours and convince everyone without explaining my condition, only he won't believe me, and even if he thinks I'm a horrible person, that's not the truth in the first place.\n\nOtherwise, how do I get out of this?"

For the most part I was a careful/decent driver, though I did cause 2 accidents (one I was making a U turn at an intersection and got t-boned by a car I somehow didn\u2019t see, the other I slightly rear-ended someone on the freeway). \n\nI\u2019m 31 now. Last summer I got diagnosed with OCD, though looking back my OCD symptoms started when I was probably around 22. I had a severe OCD episode that lasted for most of 2021 where I was barely functioning for most of that year and left me traumatized. Due to the trauma I sometimes dissociate randomly just during every day life. Between my OCD itself and the dissociation from the unhealed trauma, I would imagine that I wouldn\u2019t be a safe driver. The past accidents I was at fault for haunt me as well. Nobody was hurt last time, but what if it\u2019s worse next time?\n\nAt the very least I probably won\u2019t be a safe driver again for at least another couple years while I continue to heal from that trauma and also get my OCD symptoms under control. Thankfully I\u2019m able to make it work for now because I work from home and most of the places I go to regularly are either within walking distance, or are relatively inexpensive to get to via Uber/Lyft. \n\nIt feels embarrassing to tell people that I\u2019m a 31 year old man and don\u2019t drive and don\u2019t have a car.

    "title": "Suicidal Obsession and OCD? (TW: Suicidal thoughts)",
    "content": "So, today I got an initial diagnosis of OCD with an OCD specialist. I'll fill out a lot more detail below and I'd like to hear if anyone else has had similar experiences, but...\n\nTL;DR: Off and on for the past few months, I've been struggling with intrusive suicidal and homicidal thoughts that I don't want and that terrify me, and it's making me feel like I actually \\*am\\* depressed and worried that I actually am suicidal even though I don't really have reason to be, in a form of what I can only describe as a self-fulfilling prophecy or mental health hypochondria. It might stem from the fact that I've known a lot of people in my life who have either committed suicide or struggled with either passive or active ideation, including my first martial arts sensei, so I started comparing myself to them and what they've experienced. Often I'll deliberately think up ideas or images surrounding suicide just to see if I still react negatively to them (I do, thank God). Every time I'm in a normalized state I go back and look at journal entries from previous obsessive loops or externalize my current thoughts, I feel confused, and my reaction is, \"Huh? Who thinks that? That doesn't sound like the real me. It also sounds a little crazy.\" When I'm around peers and friends, especially at work, and I'm able to focus my mind on work, it feels a lot easier to come back to reality and wave off these silly thoughts. What do I do? Has anyone else experienced stuff like this before? I'm still able to touch and operate my weapons without too much anxiety and certainly without any REAL desire to use it against myself. The thought actually makes me twitch in discomfort. I've also never been diagnosed with clinical or persistent depression, just generalized anxiety disorder from when I was a teenager.\n\nI don't remember precisely how it started, but I think it began in late August or early September. I don't remember if I was feeling down or depressed or not (my girlfriend broke up with me back in June and I've had a couple temporary non-OCD-related work struggles, but my level of resiliency and ability to bounce back has generally been very good). Maybe I was, I can't remember a lot of detail about what I was thinking or feeling at the time. First it started as me walking around concealed carrying and realizing, and picturing, just how dangerous I could be to other people if I wanted to be, and imagining the things I could do with said gun along with some intrusive impulses, which caused an anxiety response. I was driving and I think maybe I was starting to get into one of my existential questioning loops again, wondering about the purpose of existence (both for me and as a whole). But eventually, a thought came up that went something like, \"Man, it would be so easy to just end it right here if I wanted to, the gun is right there on my hip. Why not?\" accompanied by some impulse and images and imagined feelings of what that would actually be like. There was a bit of horrified fascination to it, but that thought terrified me and made me physically twitch in discomfort. I figured it was just ye-old \"call of the void\" type of intrusive thoughts/urges. That's how it started, just what felt like a very intense awareness of the potential danger the gun represented to me and others, as well as feeling a bit on-edge whenever I was carrying, like I was much more ready to dispense violence if necessary and constantly on the lookout for threats. That might be partially due to how I've been mentally conditioning myself for my current job in the military.\n\nLater on, something else came up like, \"All the dreads and worries and burdens would be gone, and you either have the peace of oblivion or may find your answers. Is there even a point to existence anyway? You're tired, why keep fighting and surviving?\" Which again terrified me. And it's not like me at all to be nihilistic like that (except for when I'm in an existentialist thought loop), I've usually had a strong sense of purpose and meaning and a belief in a higher purpose for our existence, even if I wasn't 100% sure what that was. That led into a continuing spiral of other obsessive ruminations on questions like, \"What if I am depressed or suicidal and I'm just in denial or not realizing it? Were these thoughts actually indicators of suicidality? What would it take for me to actually be suicidal? Why should I be, aside from a few struggles this past year I have a good life. Am I just bored with or tired of my life or existence?\" Which then makes my subconscious convinced that I actually am feeling that way, or makes it throw me a bunch of thoughts or arguments or feelings along those lines, as if to convince myself or test myself that these feelings are true, such as the nihilistic thoughts I described above. If I list the reasons why I don't fit the depression or suicidality symptoms, my subconscious will be like, \"Okay, let's take those away from you now and make you feel like you actually do.\" Even now I'm worried that I'm just trying to deny the truth of depression or suicidality by latching onto this diagnosis. One of my other compulsions is internet research.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that I have a history of obsessive anxious ruminating on either my physical or mental health, as well as more existential topics, mostly when I was a child and a teenager. Had episodes at 7 and 11, but got especially bad when I was 14-15 and having my first big existential/spiritual crisis, which made a brief repeat appearance when I was in college. Other obsession topics have included moral/ethical dilemmas and choices, things I've done in the past that I regret, how I'm performing/measuring up in my job, and how other people look at and think of me as a man. As far as I know my compulsions have always manifested mentally, not physically, except for a small cough/clearing throat tic I used to have when I was a kid and a teenager. I've also occasionally moved my guns away from my nightstand or out of my room, and when doing so, felt confused about why I actually did so and also felt a little ridiculous. And finally, I had a very similar experience as a teenager, one night fearing that my problems or my feelings would get so bad that I would just end it all, and then again when my doctor prescribed me zoloft for anxiety and said that suicidal thoughts or actions were a possible side effect. Well, guess what I was thinking about and feeling that night as I tried to sleep after only taking one dose? As if just the suggestion was enough to make me feel that way."

She had always been clean but never to this extent (or maybe I\u2019m just noticing it more as I\u2019ve gotten older).\n\nEvery single day she vacuum\u2019s the house. Most days she vacuums twice a day. We have 2 cats and a short haired dog with hardwood floors. Somehow she can see EVERY single speck of dust or hair on the ground. She recently bought a vacuum with a little light on it which allows her to see even more on the ground. Even during our Christmas dinner she pulled out the vacuum to show our Grandma and ended up vacuuming cause she saw some hair on the ground. The sound of that damn vacuum drives me up the wall.\n\nMy parents have hired cleaners for the house (my mom\u2019s idea). They come every other week and clean the whole thing. She cleans and vacuums the whole house before they come.\n\nAll of our towels HAVE to be folded a certain way. Our shoes HAVE to be placed a certain way at the front door and in the closet. No dishes can be cleaned and left in the dish rack to use later. Nothing is to be ever left on the counters (water bottles, cups). I work from home sometimes and she hates that I sit on the couch in the living room to work because apparently it destroys the pillows? \n\nWhenever I do try to clean my room or do something with cleaning I get the comment \u201coh wow, you\u2019re actually cleaning?\u201d Or \u201cyou might need to get new glasses\u201d which upsets me SO much and makes me not want to clean. Besides, nothing I clean is ever up to her standard. All of her comments are backhanded.\n\nThis is been going on for a few years now and my mental health has just plummeted. She has other issues too and I feel as if my brain just isn\u2019t the same as it used to be. I resent my mom so much and I hate that I do but I can\u2019t deal with this anymore. We aren\u2019t allowed to say anything back to her as she ends up crying so I\u2019m forced to keep my mouth shut. She knows she has OCD but refuses to get professional help. What are my options here?\n\nFor context, I live in Toronto, just got out of school at age 25 and have a decent paying job but not enough to be able to afford rent yet.\n\nThank you all."

I'd be open to friendship and chats too if anyone is going through something similar.\n\nOver the last couple months my male partner has developed a love of exercise, it started with a goal to be a marathon runner and daily runs, it now is a 2 hour (or sometimes more) routine that he must do everyday which includes intensive body weights and still daily runs that also look intensive. I'm not allowed to interrupt him during this routine either and family and I have offered to pay for personal trainers or coaches and he says no.\n\nHe checks his body out in the mirror frequently and is overall really happy, as hes lost a lot of weight, but occassionally makes comments about looking for things to improve. He seems to eat well but in past has thought about doing a second workout routine after eating something \"bad\", eg having some Christmas cake at work, which I was able to talk him out of. Maybe once per fortnight or once per month he will have a rest day due to an important responsibility but says he thinks about exercising during this time.\n\nAfter work he's always been tired but now this new daily routine makes him more exhausted, irritable and touch sensitive. Usually at bed time now he just wants to listen to music alone and doesn't like me asking what he's listening to. We used to listen to a podcast together before bed but now he's too tired to interact with me at all and no touching allowed. He doesn't want to hug or cuddle anymore at night and that hurts the most for me. Naturally I'm getting upset and trying to express my feelings about this, he only gets annoyed and sometimes just rude, he feels I'm trying to stop him from doing what he feels he needs to do and claims I'm not supportive. Almost every weeknight is like this now.\n\nI feel so unheard and I'm trying hard to be patient and I'm just starting to make sense of this through the lens of an anxiety-ocd behaviour. \n\nHe's also ADHD and is going to try get meds soon to try as an adult but I'm so nervous about this because I know it could increase OCD related thoughts or behaviours. \n\nAgain I'm open to chatting with anyone if they have a similar experience or can offer support.

My dad broke up with his girlfriend of 10 years, which was basically a marriage\u2026 We had some sort of family going on. Her with her kids, my dad and my brother and I, she didn\u2019t live with us but we were really really close. She\u2019s been around for a long time\u2026 and the breakup is kind of like\u2026 a divorce. A backbone of my life is now gone and thats quite scary. Idk what life will be from now on, and as someone with chronic anxiety and ocd that\u2019s terrifying. It has changed everything for me\u2026 Im afraid my dad is too lonely, it makes me feel really guilty leaving him alone in the house and going anywhere and i know that its not my responsibility nor my fault but i feel\u2026 like i have to do something, like i have to be there. I have a therapy appointment tomorrow by the way so dont worry bout it. Well, thats one. Second is that i dont have many friends around at the moment. Like im literally either hanging out with my mom or my dad and thats it. And \u201ctaking my mind off of things\u201d is really hard because i cant really escape my mind you know? Plus the other thing with OCD thats been quite hard to handle mostly because of the stress im going through at the moment. I have issues with food. It scares me. Plans are overwhelming and i cant stop thinking about food, about getting sick and that is so annoying because i avoid plans and being outside of my house but that is also incredibly boring. Its frustrating as hell. I feel like im in purgatory. I mean medication is definitely helping but its still really fucking hard. Its hard work trying to pass as a normal functioning person all the time. Im about to cry right now. I feel like im not really here\u2026 i feel scared and weak and fragile. Like physically not well. Again, i feel lost. Like a ghost of myself. Like ive died and im just\u2026 here\u2026 trying to survive the day without a panic attack and im about to fail once again. I cant stop checking my pulse, if im pale, checking any pain in my body, checking what i eat. I try to eat without worries and that lasrs for like 20 minutes and then my afternoons consist in trying to keep myself together. I feel like fainting just because of anxiety very likely because im in a fight or flight situation at all times. I find it really really hard to relax and i know i have to try. But even breathing makes me scared and i start overthinking nonstop. My mind is going so fast with awful thoughts that terrify me every second of the day. I hardly have any fun doing anything i used to enjoy. Again, since last year I have just become a ghost of who I used to be. And that is so so sad. So sad. It makes me so sad thinkign that my life will be like this forever till the day i die and I cant help but think about how long am i going to\u2026 be able to be like this. Idk. I dont know who to talk to. Im embarrassed to tell this to my therapist because i dont want to look like a failure and a helpless useless idiot. Its even more embarrassing to tell my parents. I\u2019ve been like this for a whole year. It all started an entire year ago. And while yes, its been alright from time to time, when Im in a state like this, i can only think and fear of the lows.

I would ruminate on the specific instance of the \"sinful\" thought(s) for minutes to hours on end each time this occurred. After an absurdly scary period of doing this, eventually I would reassure myself that I wasn't doomed enough to calm myself down again.\n\nAs soon as I was calm again, my mind would start to relentlessly bombard me with \"sinful\" thoughts again, with me resisting them with every might of my being until I would fail to, causing me to have another instance of thinking I had an irredeemable thought and then ruminating on it to reassure myself. It was a vicious, two-stage cycle. Wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.\n\nCue one time where I had just entered the calm phase of my cycle and was feeling good again. I decided to go for a run around my neighborhood streets for some refreshing exercise. As I was running up the big hill of my neighborhood, I decided to make a pointless and stupid \"wager\" with myself in my own head, where if I voluntarily stopped running up the hill before it ended, I would give up my eternal salvation. (You know when you're a kid and you do something like, shoot a basketball and say \"if I miss this my mom dies\"? That sort of thing. Although I may not need to contextualize this as I imagine many of y'all continue to make these dumb 'wagers' into adulthood because of OCD.)\n\nAnyway, I was not bothered at all making this wager, and I did so completely voluntarily, because I knew I would never voluntarily stop running up the hill before it ended. But the issue was, the hill ended gradually enough to where it was hard to tell when the ground stopped becoming an incline. Needing certainty that I wouldn't stop running before the incline ended, I continued to run well after the hill ended, at a place in the street in all actuality was actually going downhill. But I wasn't convinced enough at the time due to the severity of my \"wager\". I was starting to feel panicky by this point that I would not be able to find a place to stop that was for sure downhill before my run ended.\n\nSo at a place that I thought might be downhill enough, feeling panicky and wanting this run to end so that I could end my \"wager\", I impulsively stopped at a place I thought could be downhill enough. But shortly after stopping, I examined where I stopped and found that it may have actually been uphill slightly. \n\nCue the worst panic attack I've ever had in my life. I thought that was it for me. I thought that I had willfully, completely given up my salvation and there was no turning back. I entered back into my house in a totally crazen state and yelled at both of my parents about it. They immediately tried to tell me what I was one million-level panicked about was not real and nonsense. But I was yelling and screaming and crying so loud, arguing with them so profusely about how it was real, that my mother got fed up and said \"alright 55559585, you know what? Fine! You did it! You ARE going to Hell now!\" I remember yelling \"NOOOOOOOO!\" several times completely genuinely. I was running back and forth as fast as I could, screaming as loud as I could, crying as much as I ever have, all in full humiliating view for my parents to see. I was tensing my body as much as I could, flapping my arms around like I was possessed. It was so bad it gave me an experience of what I would consider true human suffering in a way I hadn't had before in my otherwise pretty nice life. I never want to repeat that.\n\nI ended up ruminating on that one too, and eventually calmed myself down again, continuing the vicious cycle. But there was no instance worse than that.\n\nWhat about y'all? Don't reply if you don't feel comfortable, of course."

Which doubles as the reason for it being \"incurable\" (and triples as the cure itself).\n\nBut the statistics really don't sit right with me. When I learned about OCD in-depth, I soon started noticing highly similar patterns in some of my friends, who, if had or looked into any mental health troubles, weren't looking into OCD. I also noticed it in some posts online that weren't directly referencing OCD (an example would be queer subreddits with people having trouble distinguishing a genuine thought on their SO/GI from an intrusive one). Hell, some of these patterns are memed to an extent, and not just in OCD safespaces. I also live in a country where mental health is still somewhat of a stigma, and OCD definitely isn't something commonly discussed.\n\nIs it really this uncommon to overthink? Is it only diagnosed when it severely impacts function and potentially requires medication? Does it mean that a degradation of daily functioning is where casual overthinking (if that's even a thing) ends and OCD begins? Or maybe it's a highly prevalent symptom in other disorders? (I don't know about you, but I don't believe anyone is truly healthy mentally or physically.)\n\nIn fact, my ordeal was largely a reaction to a medication that isn't even meant to alter my mind (cyproterone acetate, synthetic progesterone derivative). I was only diagnosed with BPD earlier in my life.\n\nInterested in hearing your thoughts on this. I know I'm oversimplifying it, that's part of the reason I'm asking."

I don't really have much of a physical type, like I did find all of my crushes physically attractive, but it was more about their inner qualities that drew me to them. I think that the reason why I've been so attracted to confident people my whole life is because confidence is a trait that I personally lack, since my OCD causes me to be in a constant state of doubt and uncertainty.\n\n  \nDoes OCD make crushes a miserable experience for everyone who has it, or can some people have OCD and still enjoy crushes without letting it destroying them mentally?

I prefer women in porn but my bf in person (when Im in a good headspace and can actually focus). porn has really been cut out of my life but I dont have as adverse of a reaction to \"ooo image of topless woman\" as I used to, but I also dont get turned on by my bf lately unless im a) in the mood b) he's also getting aroused (responsive libido, I think). idk, im generally turned off by most people now cuz im with him but lately im even turned off with him cuz ive been depressed and obsessing about if im a lesbian or if im just in a slump mentally and cuz of my birth control? I do love him both romantically and sexually but both of those have felt like less lately? and im searching for the feeling again, which I know is a compulsion and then the feeling of butterflies and love eludes me again.\n\nI keep having these thoughts about my friends, sexual in nature, I feel slightly nauseous having them. then I get memories of the first crush I had on a girl, somewhat toxic tbh. and I compare how I feel with my bf today to how I felt with her when we weren't even dating. im over her but im kinda obsessing about that situation specifically and seeing if I felt more for her compared to my bf, they both felt the same, hers maybe more intense and ongoing compared to the butterflies with my bf but thats cuz of the on again off again issues we had when we were friends. if I dated her the same lack of butterflies would follow that have happened with me and my bf. so im kinda using that as a reassurance ig. which might be bad\n\nidk im a lot less anxious. I think im in a backdoor spike but im not questioning why im not anxious that much. and then theres the occasional obsession but im not googling but I think I am ruminating a little bit. which kinda makes me worry I am a lesbian. or that im gonna leave my bf in 10-15 yrs cuz ive been denying smthn about myself even tho I haven't. I dont think. idk\n\nsex is great and pleasurable, its never anything like porn which is normal im sure, but it still feels good, I feel good, when im not panicking, and he feels good which makes me happy but my brain worries im only doing it for attention and validation cuz I dont feel feral and horny for him when we do make out, no butterflies and im wet but I dont have those intense heartbeat sensations down there, they're there but they're not that intense so I go over every memory of sex/intimacy to see if I felt enough or if I was anxious before it or enjoyed it.\n\nidk. dirty talk is just talk for me now and it doesn't add much when I say anything, I do find it fun tho, even before I had more of a reaction if he said smthn. he makes a face which gets him going and him getting going gets me going. he doesn't do as much dirty talk or hair pulling/tying up lately cuz our sexy times have been decently short cuz I haven't been in the mood for long sessions which again worries me that im a lesbian. I felt a lot more when we first started dating cuz it was new but all the things have been said and done 11 months in, maybe we just need to do new stuff and reconnect sexually, when im feeling better. I think part of the reason I dont crave sex or feel as horny or enjoy sex as much is my birth control, before getting it, even when I was in the throes of ocd, I still enjoyed sex/intimacy with him, it didn't reassure me tho so im worried that I only did it for validation even tho I wanted it for me. and im worried my lack of eye contact makes me a lesbian. idk. its a lot of random little things that dont even correlate to anything but cuz I saw this story or that story about a lesbian here or on TikTok or google, I worry its me. we have had to stop before sex started cuz I was bombarded by intrusive thoughts or I was worried about not enjoying it or id zone out while we were having sex. I used to be so much more present, I think, which makes me go over my memories again to think about if I was engaged. im so tired. I dont even feel like crying. im just. exhausted. I just wanna feel better about loving him. and being active during sex. I used to have so much more energy for it. and doing more things. idk. I also wanna feel the warmth I got before. idk if im just obsessing or if smthn is actually off. im awkward with sex talk and eye contact which my brain is now perceiving as not awkwardness but me being a liar and acting when it comes to sex with my bf and that im a lesbian. \n\nthe obsessions are driving me mad. I worry I like my friends even tho I dont. I dont get butterfly anxious, just sweaty anxious and nauseous. I worry I was never boy crazy enough to be considered bi. im worried that ive only been acting when it comes to sex and that nothing that ive said has been genuine both in and out of the bedroom and it was all comphet and ive never been fulfilled "

However, after a couple of weeks, the intrusive thoughts return.\n\nIt's been constant, so her doc suggested she switch to Prozac. This began with a 50% taper from zoloft, and this was 2 weeks ago. During the 1st day or two of the taper, her OCD ramped up, which I can understand. After that she was completely fine! Like I haven't seen her that happy and at peace for a long time. So, no matter if she's going up or down with meds, she still feels a positive difference for a week, and then right back into OCD. Could this be her internalizing or obsessively looking for her intrusive thoughts to return?\n\nHas anybody seen or experienced this? I just want to help as much as I can. I've personally dealt with Panic Disorder and anxiety, but my methods and tools may differ from what she needs with her OCD.

However, I started waking up every hour during the night, so my doctor temporarily took me off Abilify to see if the sleep issues would persist. I was left only on Effexor 75 mg, and oh god, that was such a mistake.\n\nWhile I was on Abilify, I felt like I had partially recovered from OCD. But just three days after stopping it, all my symptoms came back: intrusive thoughts, extreme anxiety, and suicidal ideation. I don\u2019t feel like myself at all. I\u2019m experiencing constant mood swings, arguing with my girlfriend all the time, and I feel completely numb emotionally. The suicidal thoughts have become so intense that, for the first time in my life, I\u2019ve resorted to self harm.\n\nMost of the time, my main theme has been ROCD, but now it\u2019s reached its limit. It\u2019s so intense that it feels unbearable, like I have to break up with my girlfriend just to save her from me. Suddenly, everything bothers me, and I feel like the relationship doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. Physical symptoms have also come back, like a lump in my throat or a sensation of heat.\n\nI keep having intrusive images in my head ; either sexual or related to suicide. I cry constantly. My mind feels empty, yet at the same time, I have this uncontrollable flood of thoughts. I\u2019ve even gone back to using drugs.\n\nI\u2019ve been oversleeping and have zero motivation, yet I go from feeling happy to being angry for no reason. Suddenly, it bothers me that my girlfriend has friends, even though it never bothered me before because it\u2019s normal to have friends.. Now I feel like I have to break up with her, like I\u2019m a terrible person. I feel like I\u2019m messing with her head, too.\n\nI started abilify again this morning , after consultating it with my doctor, but I feel like I'll never be the same."

    "content": "Hi. This is gonna be a long post, i'm not an English speaker so there could be a few mistakes\nI've always suffered of ocd since I was a child, l used to blow on my hands if not a monster would have catch me, growing up l used to touch things three times otherwise my parents would have died, etc etc (the usual stuffs) Around when I was 14 l have had what I consider my first \"trauma\" nothing special really happened, I was just insulted/ bullied on the bus by a random girl, after that episode l've started to having all my compulsions and obsession about it (example: this thing happened in Halloween and every time I heard the world Halloween I had to do a long ass compulsion that lasted like 3 hours) after that, other two \"traumas\" happened, every time one get it the other leave, I can have only one thing i obsessed over and over, my last trauma obsession lasted for 8 years, and is still going on (my psychiatrist has said that I have a really strong ocd, one of the strongest, and that I am aware of that) Long story short a few days ago me and my friend went in a restaurant, it was one of those really fancy and rich one, those where I never really go bc they are too expensive and also not my kind of thing, I prefer other kind of places, more cozy and less \"luxury\" So we go in this extreme fancy restaurant and it was full of rich old people, old women full of filler on their lips and boobs, and there was this other table that was made of old and ugly men and young and beautiful women, all my age, all my nationality, thev were escorts. I've alwavs imaained escort girls to be from another nationality and like full of filler, older, but no, they where exactly like me. I'm f25. When I was 21/22 I really wanted to do what they were doing, going in fancy restaurants and being paid for that, without having sex or anything, just having a dinner with rich men and that's it, seems strange but a lot of men just want that. Growing up I totally detached from this kind of things and l've started to live my easy cozy and slow life that I LOVE and I WANT BACK, bc since we came back from that restaurant I've been obsessing by wanting to go to dinners with old rich men, actually not for the money, not for the luxurious life and fancy restaurant (I don't care at all about none of this things) but just and only for the power of being young and pretty. I feel that I have this power of being young and pretty and I have to use it, now I feel guilty for staying at home painting or playing video games, this are all things I LOVED TO DO, but now I feel that i'm wasting my time since i'm not gonna be young and pretty forever. And the fact that wanting to become an escort (for escort I mean no sex, just and only dinners) destroys the easy and cozy life, triggers me even more, bc the base of ocd is literally not letting me leave in peace, so since lining a cozy life makes me happy, this escort thing triggers me a lot a make me more obsessive about it Mind that I DONT WANT to have this thought, I want to go back to my easy and cozy life, but now i'm checking the hostess/ escort websites and thinking to make an account bc I feel I MUST use this power of being young and pretty, I must use this power so much that I actually think I WANT to do this."

Then it became day-to-day perfectionism, where I would create realities where if I messed up I *should* die, not *will*. Psychiatrists always chocked that up to depression, and wouldn\u2019t understand that those thoughts are 100% out of my control, unwanted, and unbelievable. There\u2019s just a spectator on my shoulder that says he knows when I\u2019ll die type shit. Now over 10 years later it\u2019s become an obsession with numbers and patterns, intrusive thoughts at night (which have fueled my struggle with substance and alcohol use), and intrusive sexual thoughts that I would never EVER want to exist. I know the main struggle with this is accepting intrusive thoughts and letting them pass by, but my mind is so deadset on forcing them down which seems to only stoke the fire.

I have never come across someone who has this same exact obsession, although I'm sure they're out there. This fear has waxed and waned since 1st grade or so (25 now), but hit its peak at age 23 when I gagged in a *very* public bar. After that, I faced sporadic gagging due to panic for about a year. In cars, at doctor's appointments, while driving, on phone calls, at my grad school graduation, etc. Still not sure why, still terrified of it happening to this day. Hasn't happened in over a year now but I still think about it every single day. \n\nMy main symptoms/limitations/compulsions are: \n- Compulsive tic tac or altoid use (any time my throat feels tight or I feel like I'm going to gag, I eat a tic tac)\n- Extreme fixation on throat sensations and tightness\n- Chronic throat tightness \n- Avoiding situations where it would be embarrassing to gag if I happen to be preoccupied about it that day (the gym, bars, concerts, museums, anywhere where it would be difficult to escape quickly)\n- Limitation of workouts (I'm an avid gym goer, but 75% of my workouts are impacted or cut short due to feeling like I'm going to gag)\n- Difficulty talking/fear of gagging in one on one conversations (One on one conversations are the #1 staple of my job, so you see my issue) \n- Complete avoidance of air travel and airports (I had made massive progress flying prior to age 23 and the gagging event) \n- Anxiety leading up to big events (what if I gag?)\n- Anxious traveling via car (even though I regularly make 6-7 hour road trips, I'm worried I'll gag the whole time) \n\nI'm actually *miserable*. I know this is a somatic obsession. I know that the actual theme itself doesn't matter, and rather that it's just a classic manifestation of OCD, just like any of my other themes were. I know ERP is the gold standard, but at this point I'm not willing to work myself up the hierarchy to gagging. Every time it happened it re-\"traumatized\" me.\n\nThoughts?

    "title": "Anxiety over fear of death",
    "content": "Posting this from a burner, historically I've never had any depression/anxiety/any other mental health struggles, my life was great for the most part so maybe this comes from a fear of losing that. Furthermore, I have always had intrusive thoughts, even about fear of death, but they would be fleeting and wouldn't affect my long term mood.\n\nWith that said, a month ago when I was high, I tried thinking about what the sensation of being dead is like. I'm an atheist, and I think being dead is the state of nothingness, such as being asleep or before the time I was born. However, the issue is that both being asleep and the time before I was born came to an end due to me waking up/being born, and being dead does not have an end. This led to a panic attack until I fell asleep.\n\nSince then, I have had recurring intrusive thoughts revolving around three themes that cause anxiety:\n\n1. I don't know what it feels like to be dead\n2. My life is great, I want to die on my own terms and not due to some accident/disease\n3. I love my family and assuming the above doesn't happen, I'll be devastated when my parents pass\n\nFor the most part, the anxiety I feel is just doom and stress. However, lately it has been causing me to wake up earlier than normal, I feel a pit in my stomach, and my legs feel tense/tingly. When my mind is preoccupied with something else, I feel completely fine until one of the three thoughts pops up in my head, completely ruining my day. It's like \"Wow, I feel great! It's because I'm not thinking about...\". Even just thinking about this anxiety makes it worse. Furthermore, previously whenever my mind was idle, I would daydream about neutral things such as my hobbies or memories. Now, my mind is just occupied by these three thoughts and I can't daydream about anything else.\n\nIs there a path out of this, whether its stopping these thoughts from forming, or preventing these thoughts from causing anxiety and gloom?\n\n"

    "content": "Hey all. I was diagnosed with ocd after a complex trauma event ended in August. In October I started getting very neurotic symptoms, but I wouldn\u2019t consider it ocd. Some point in October, I took a buspar and had panic attacks. I convinced myself the meds were an issue and I wouldn\u2019t take the meds (they were as needed anyway). \nThen, the first week of November I ate a meat stick and gave myself a panic attack. Then it became food was going to give me panic. I spent the several days on just water until I was worried about my toothpaste, skin care products, soaps, chemicals, etc. \n\nI quit my job and spent two weeks doing nothing (including any sort of hygiene) but lay in bed and drink juice and water. I was able to see my therapist, and we moved to Ensures and then some solids. It\u2019s sealed foods that I know aren\u2019t tampered with, so essentially junk. The past month has been the same foods and Ensure everyday (honestly, I\u2019m content unless I see food I want to eat). I still hold reservations about the soaps, toothpaste, and chemicals but I\u2019m at a satisfactory level with that. \n\nI was prescribed Seroquel from the gp and didn\u2019t take it because \u201cI\u2019m not psychotic enough to take this; it will give me panic; the gp doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s best\u201d. Then I saw a psychiatrist and he gave me Paxil. I haven\u2019t been able to take it even though he urges me and has suggested cutting the lowest dose to a quarter. I am convinced it will cause my mental duress and I can\u2019t shake the feeling. I do exposure but it doesn\u2019t make me feel better. \n\nMore recently, I have been doing very bad with depression and anxiety and magical thinking. I am doing everything I\u2019m supposed to but I\u2019m doing worse than ever. I can\u2019t go out with people, I won\u2019t breathe & run if I smell scents that might \u201cmake me high\u201d, I won\u2019t try new foods, I keep losing more weight (150-114 since oct im 5\u20197), and began having severe mental anger towards anyone who uses any substance for any reason. \n\nThis isn\u2019t me. I never did these things to such an extreme extent. I am going mad because I\u2019m not getting better and I obsess over SH thoughts even though I don\u2019t want to and I\u2019m terrified of the idea of it.\n\n I know I\u2019m in a crisis and everyone knows, but I\u2019m too scared to admit myself to the hospital. I\u2019m terrified of medication, being around crazy people (bc it would be transmitted i guess? lol), being without my safe things, being forced to eat foods, and a general loss of control. \n\nI need to get better but every route is terrifying. I refused to do bloodwork twice, refused numbing when i filled cavities, and refuse to drive anywhere that smells bad. Is there anything you have used that helps you? I\u2019m so exhausted living like this. I want to take meds as soon as I get better enough to, but I\u2019m afraid that point will never exist.\n\nI know it sounds psychotic, but I\u2019m in constant supervision from family and constant contact with the therapist and psychiatrist. They\u2019re all vigilant. Also, please don\u2019t comment anything about psychosis or illicit substances, it makes me anxious as silly as it sounds. I don\u2019t mean to run from those topics, but they\u2019re not something I need to fix at the present moment. "

I\u2019m 20 now and much more stable, on a high medication dose and very functional. I am excited for the next year.\n\nThis being said, i still have obsessions and a pretty severe skin picking compulsion that i spend usually 3+ hours a day on when I\u2019m supposed to be doing other things (studying, packing, chilling etc.). The main thing that stops me from doing it is having people around who I don\u2019t want to make uncomfortable, and I\u2019ve shared a room up until now. \n\nI am aware I will need to exercise a good amount of distress tolerance and discipline during this time to prevent my previously very severe OCD and dermatillomania relapsing- especially with so much time to myself in which I will have to form my own routine and schedule. This was previously a problem, where I scheduled myself down to the minute and thought my day was somehow going to be doomed or bad if I strayed even by a minute. \n\nI am still under treatment by a health team and will have other adults living in the house with me, but I would also like to see if anyone else has faced this situation before? I don\u2019t want to have to rely on my new housemates to help control things that as an adult I feel I need to take responsibility for. \n\nIt is worth noting that I have experienced psychotic episodes before as part of my OCD and been hospitalised for them.

I also have a pretty low sense of self-worth in general, which contributes. Because i'm so guilt motivated, people sometimes use it to manipulate me. Even my own partner will sometimes use guilt to push me into getting them things even when i can't afford it. An example that bothers me a lot being valentines day a few years back. I went pretty all-out, got them three seperate gifts, made a cheese-board, etc, and they didn't like any of it. To make up for my failure at providing the valentines day they wanted, they made me spend 80 dollars i couldnt afford on a bong that they then also didn't like and wound up selling. I felt so guilty in the moment for dissapointing them that i went along with it, even though looking back at the situation i find the request completely unreasonable and disrespectful. I have also on multiple occasions given away money to scammers who used fake stories to make me feel guilty and obligated to help them. It hit me last night just how much i do things that i dont want to or that are bad for me, compulsively out of a sense of moral obligation, and i dont wanna do it anymore, but the guilt always consumes me :("

I\u2019ve apologized multiple times for anything I may have done wrong, but they didn\u2019t really want to hear it.\n\nSince then, people from that group have unfriended me on social media, which has been really hard. They\u2019re social media people, so it feels like a statement, not just a quiet drift apart. What\u2019s even harder is that they still view everything I post. I\u2019ve reached out to a few mutual friends who I thought I was still on good terms with, but they\u2019ve ignored me completely.\n\nIt\u2019s left me wondering what was said behind my back and how the story may have been spun.

I do think of myself as a kind and understanding person but when I'm feeling particularly overstimulated I find that I lash out on people.\n\nMost of the times it's because I am provoked or my fears or thoughts are unvalidated. I'll try to keep it short but I grew up in an unstable household with an abusive father and had to witness things children shouldn't see. Ultimately, because I was a minor, it always felt like adults made decisions for me and I had no choice but to accept whatever was thrown my way. I was very happy to eventually move away with my mom but she ended up remarrying a guy that is more or less like my dad. I currently live with them and although I love her I cannot wait to leave. Her and I had a discussion and because I was triggered by something she said I told her I am looking forward to finishing my degree and leaving the house. I think she got hurt because of it. I was really overstimulated, but I feel so unheard at times it's really painful.\n\nIt feels like that anger I felt as a child and teenager is still within me and I'm not sure how to turn it into something productive or make something good out of it. I'm still very angry that my life turned out completely different from what little me had hoped for me. Because I feel guilty for bursting out I end up feeling extremely guilty and apologizing for saying mean things but I never see any changes in others and some other time I get hurt again (e.g. I say that one thing triggered my OCD and I'm told it's silly and it's no big deal).\n\nI feel angry and guilty at the same time, I don't know what to do. I would appreciate your advice. Thanks in advance.\n\n(edit: typo)"

    "content": "To give some context, my girlfriend now fianc\u00e9e is doing her medical residency in another city, I work in software dev and WFH, and I've committed to moving in with her until she finishes and move back to our home city. \n\nShe is an extreme clean neat freak, and I am the polar opposite. Her apartment is beautiful, it looks like it's out of a magazine, spotless and everything is perfectly placed and has some aesthetic. I have had a hard time adjusting to living with her full time as the things she demands and requires a living space to be, seem a bit over the edge. \nTo give examples, every single surface of every single room must not only look aesthetic, but have no items on them, be exactly how she left it, and always be dust free. She will wipe down kitchen counters 3-4 times a day and get extremely irritated if anything is left out, not the way she left it/ expects it. \nThis can apply to things that belong to me like deodorant and cologne that I use daily on bathroom counters, pills that I take daily on kitchen counter with my food, my personal items on nightstand, or my laptop and work stuff on the desk. Everything must be put away out of sight. Everything must be cleaned immediately after use, no dishes in the sink, bed made immediately after waking up, wipe down surface after using the bathroom, etc....\n\nSince I havent moved in full time yet, I come with a suitcase, and i usually leave the suitcase in the corner of the bedroom open so I can use it as a dresser to get new clothes from each day. She wants it in a closet, but I dont have a real place to put these clothes so it would mean taking the suitcase out and putting it away to just access my clothes which seems insane.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think that a lot of these things are good habits like just being generally clean, not leaving dishes to accumulate, etc... but it just feels a bit too far to always have to do in the moment.\n\nI feel that if I am using it every single day, why should I need to hide it in a drawer out of sight to bring it out and put it away again after every single time? \nI have asked her that if she wants me to do that, then to give me place/room inside a cupboard or drawer to store these things, but most of the time they are filled with her things and there isn't room for my stuff.\nIt gives me the impression that I don't really live here, I am just here as a guest that needs to have their belongings hidden away instead of actually living here with her. \n\nIt also gives me stress that every single action that I need to do, there needs to be a compensating cleaning/ putting away action that it's just overwhelming to have to do all the time. This makes it not feel like I am at home, but more so at her home and makes it hard to call this my own living space even though she wants me to live here.    \n\nWe have talked about it a few times and she is aware , but she will acknowledge it, change a bit for a day, and revert back to factory settings of OCD the next day. \n\nAs well, she has a few OCD ticks: \n1) where she will pick scratch down the side of her thumb with her index finger nail to the point that it breaks skin and bleeds, forms a callus , and it becomes a compulsion to keep doing it, sometimes when she is stressed, other times just to pass the time. \n2) Every night before bed, she must go to her alarms, and hear the sound go off to test it 3 times so she is sure that it will go off. I can't explain why she does this, maybe she slept through an alarm once. I've explained to her that a recurring alarm doesnt need to be tested every day to make sure it's gonna go off, if it worked the day before, and the config is correct, it will go off exactly the same way tomorrow. \nAll of the above just builds up the anxiety around everyday actions that I feel like I am better when i just lock myself in the office space , and stay there so I don't have to compensate clean everything I touch. \n\nThis may seem like a long rant, I love my girlfriend/fianc\u00e9e, and want to work with her and live with her, but these things seem like huge barriers to making this space feel like a home to me . What can I do to help her, and work with her ? And what are things that maybe I am overreacting about and should be changing myself? \nI need some outside perspective on this."

I go through mental compulsions, and for a while I was able to listen to music to distract myself from the noise in my brain. I love music and it means a lot to me so this was a meaningful, meditating activity for me\n\nFor the past bit though, it no longer works. The OCD thoughts just power right over the music. It\u2019s like the OCD adapted to it. So now listening to music is not only difficult but frustrating, because I\u2019ll go through a song and realize I wasn\u2019t even listening at all. I want to be able to listen to music and appreciate it like I used to\n\nI try different breathing and grounding techniques such as trying to focus on what my body feels, or trying to focus on my sense of hearing and it somewhat works sometimes\n\nJust wondering if anyone can relate or if anyone has some other tips they\u2019ve found to help focus.

    "content": "This is the first time I have sought out other people with OCD and I am very scared of posting something wrong/against the guidelines but I have decided I will try posting anyway. \n\nI will share a little of my story as I feel it may help people to understand where my OCD has stemmed from. I hope that's okay. \n\nI was a victim of CSA for many years as a child. I was unaware of this until I was 21 (I am now 29, F) as I had completely dissociated from these experiences until the memories/flashbacks/nightmares began to emerge. I am now able to put together a timeline of events for the most part, although some things are still very fractured. When I was 21ish, I was hospitalised for EUPD and have remained in hospital ever since, although I am now finally coming up to discharge. \n\nI don't have a clear view of when my OCD started because I believe that I may have had symptoms long before I was diagnosed a few years ago. I had constant intrusive thoughts about people believing I was a liar and went out of my way to prove to people that I was not lying even when they had not expressed any doubt. I was such a perfectionist and refused to do anything if I did not believe I could achieve perfection, which was often, and that ate away at my hobbies and interests, such as drawing and painting. \n\nBut when I was 18 is when things seriously started affecting my life. I was studying my A levels, I wanted to be a children's nurse. I got into 4 out of my 5 university choices, but my 4th and final offer was to my university of choice, after an extensive interview. I went to the interview (completely unaware of my previous CSA) and started having intrusive thoughts about me being a paedophile. I kept telling myself I wasn't attracted to children, but thoughts and images kept popping up in my mind, and I became convinced that I MUST be a paedophile, even though I also KNEW I wasn't. I completed the interview, very distressed, but at this point I had decided that it was not safe for me to work with children because what if I abused them? My entire lifes dream fell apart in the space of a few hours. I then went and took an OD, and carried on with my day like it was nothing. My next stop that day was a shift at Childline, where I was a volunteer at the time. With my new found belief that I was a paedophile, I could not pick up the phone or answer any online messages, and halfway through my shift, I told the supervisor I had to quit without giving a reason because it was so shameful. \n\nAfter that, I quit education, I quit work, I quit socialising and stayed home in my flat at all times, with my ex girlfriend whom I lived with at the time.I became completely reliant on benefits to get by. I was an anxious wreck and became terrified of particular situations. I avoided even going to the shop across the road, in case there were any children around. I became very reliant on my girlfriend. I would spend my days in bed, the only place I felt safe, and would spend all my awake time reading books about dogs (what I think was my first compulsion, even now I can't make sense of it). Book after book, the book had to be about a dog, a person with a dog, or factual information about dogs. I would order them online, or my girlfriend would go to the library to find them for me. I amassed quite a collection, which I was EVENTUALLY able to part with (although I have kept one, that I constantly read and reread, it's called Dog Medicine if anyone's interested). This went on for a number of weeks/months. Eventually I was able to leave my bed and start doing things around the flat, even sometimes venturing outside. But I had to have a shower every single morning (I know this is quite normal for a large portion of the population, but unusual for me until this point) and then meticulously apply my makeup. If my eyebrows did not look the same, I would have to wipe off my entire face and start fresh. If after the second or third time my eyebrows still did not look 'right' I would take off all my makeup and refuse to leave the flat because I believed that something bad was going to happen to me. I also began checking the locks on the top and bottom doors several times a day, and night. I was intensely afraid of bumping into my landlord or neighbours so I would only leave early in the morning or late at night. \n\nMy symptoms weren't too severe, although, they sort of manifested as AN for a while. Lots of ristualistic behaviour around eating, weighing things, avoiding certain foods, cutting food into tiny pieces, a certain amount of chews (15) before swallowing, all because of this control made me feel 'safe' and eased my anxiety. It was never about weight, but I did lose a lot of weight.  \n\nIt went unnoticed for quite a long time, even by me, but during my recent years in hospital, after the revelation of my CSA, I became heavily reliant on ritualistic behaviour and compulsions again, and thus I was diagnosed with OCD but I didn't take it seriously. I will note, though, that after my revelation about my CSA, my intrusive thoughts became less about *ME* being a paedophile, and more about other people being a paedophile. If I go on leave, and I see two men with a young girl, which seems to happen quite often, I become intensely scared for the young girl, and have to fight my instincts to 'rescue' her and rely on a lot of reassurance from the staff member who is with me and also breathing in shapes and patterns.\n\nAnyway, on to present day. In the last few months, we have begun to discuss my discharge, which has brought up a lot of fear and anxiety for me. My fear of being a paedophile is back stronger than ever, I am constantly checking my search history to see if I have been searching for child pornography, I have been trying to remember whether I have been abusing children without realising or on purpose, or if I abused my younger brothers. I also can't walk past schools, parks, playgrounds and I find public transport difficult too because there are often babies/children on there and I CANNOT make eye contact or smile at the incase the parents think I am a predator. I also know that I will never have children, because even though I KNOW I would never abuse them, what if I did? I get graphic images of myself SA'ing babies, both boys and girls, what if I AM a paedophile? What if these images became a reality? I am not to be trusted around babies or children. \n\nSince we began discussing discharge, my routines/compulsions have become a lot more strict, especially regarding cleanliness. Every morning I get out of bed, put on my glasses, apply lip balm, put my slippers and dressing gown on, go downstairs, have my medication, come back upstairs, make my bed (over and over until it is completely 'perfect'). Then my next step is to go for a shower, which has to be done in the correct order, so first I take off my dressing gown, fold it up and put it in my wardrobe, next I take off my slippers and place them together, next to my bed. Then I straighten my rug back up in the centre of the room because I obviously moved it when I walked on it. I carefully select what clothes I am going to wear that day from my wardrobe, usually based on how I feel I want to be perceived that day, even though the clothes make no actual difference. After that, I head into the bathroom. I wash my hands in a very specific way, rinse them, clean the taps, then dry my hands thoroughly on my hand towel. Then I take my pyjamas off, folding each item and then placing it into the laundry basket. Then I close the shower curtain, turn on the shower and step in facing the water. Then I turn around and face away from the shower and completely wet my hair. First, I shampoo my hair, I lather up the shampoo in my hair until I am completely sure it is clean which usually takes at least five minutes, if not longer. Then I rinse it out, and apply conditioner, in the same way as I applied the shampoo but I don't rinse it out. I then  squeeze shower gel into my hand (I don't use loofahs, shower puffs etc because germs and mold) and wash my body (I don't think I need to or should go into detail about how I do this). I then rinse my body, and then rinse the conditioner out of my hair. If I have not done this all CORRECTLY I have to do every step over again. When I am satisfied I a have done it properly, I open the shower curtain and grab my towel, and dry myself completely head to toe EXCEPT for my feet. I step out of the shower, and dry my feet. I then wash my hands as before, and dry thoroughly as before. Apply deodorant then I get dressed, first underwear, then bra, then trousers, then top. I wash and dry my hands again. Then I brush my teeth for exactly two minutes, with four pumps of my favourite toothpaste. Then I rinse my mouth with mouthwash, and rinse my toothbrush, then I brush my teeth with tooth whitening powder for exactly two minutes, then I rinse my mouth with water and rinse my toothbrush, then I brush my teeth with four pumps of purple toothpaste for exactly two minutes, and rinse my mouth out with water, and rinse my toothbrush. I put all of the products back in the appropriate (correct) place. Then I wash my face. First with cleanser, rinse, dry. Apply serum, rub in completely (I think I am allergic to this serum because it burns but I feel I have to use it). Apply a SMALL amount of moisturiser, rub in completely. Apply face primer, rub in completely. Then I wash my hands and clean the taps and dry my hands, just as before. Then I walk back into my bedroom, and put back on my glasses. Then put on my socks and slippers.Then back to the bathroom to wash my hands, wash taps, dry hands. Back to the bedroom where I will finally turn on my speaker, spend ages looking for the 'right' playlist for the day, check my messages, apply lip balm, and fill up my water bottle OR make a coffee with my coffee machine. Then I wash my hands, taps, and dry, again. This all has to be done EXACTLY the right way, in the right order, or I have to do certain steps again. This morning I had to shower twice and at one stage I had to wash my hands, start to finish, four times because I kept forgetting if I had done it 'properly'. All of this to spend all day in my bedroom apart from going downstairs to collect my meds three more times during the day/evening. Then repeat this all over again when I am ready for bed.\n\nMy hands are currently bright red, sore, and very dry. But I can't even moisturise them because it makes me feel first so I have to wash my hands again. My face is also red, dry and sore, but I also have a rash on both cheeks because of my heavy use of chemicals on my face (that I may or may not also be allergic to). \n\nI am aware this is a VERY long post so I am going to leave it there. Partly because I am now sure I don't have OCD, and I must be a paedophile (but I am NOT a paedophile, at the same time). Thank you to any of you who read this far. I don't expect that get any responses really, but it would be nice if I did. \n\nGoodnight everyone (it's now 04:06 in the morning, I have written this out and amended it several times since 01:00 and I am still sure it is it not perfect).

Just to be clear, I'm diagnosed with both but there is some stuff I don't understand fully yet about my OCD.\n\nBut often I find myself afraid of something ending or running out of something. For example, when I meet new people all I can think is how our relationship might end (Either by not communicating anymore, moving, or death). \n\nNot just people but I fear running out of things. I have bought several lego sets and I never built them, since I feel the fun in having legos is building them and once they are built... there is no more fun in it (I have never finished a single set bc of this). I buy notebooks that I never use bc I fear of doing something imperfect or finishing all pages, so I just stick to printing paper. I enjoy writing and making other forms of art but I can never finish it, I need to keep adding stuff to it so it's not over (though at the same time I wish to finish it). \n\nI have done this with food as well. Where I avoid eating if I know I'm gonna eat it all. Same with self care, when I notice I have very little soap I struggle to use it because I don't want it to be over. I do this with pretty much anything you can think of. II refuse to take meds somedays because I see I'm running out or feel they will be better for another occasion (ignoring the fact I have a box full of expired pills for this reason)\n\nIt's frustrating because I can never finish anything. So far it hasn't affected my academic life, though I believe it's just cause the anxiety of failing is greater than that of finishing a task. It feels I can never finish anything because of this underlying fear. I never realized how much it took control of my life until recently. And when I do something, I have a hard time enjoying it. While doing something I want to be done, but if I do miraculously happen to finish something I feel displeased because there is nothing more to do. Sometimes I manage to convince myself to do smaller tasks since these are part of a bigger task. Example, if I find myself cleaning my room I'm able to sweep, dust, mop... since the task at hand is cleaning my room- however I might never organize things properly. Sometimes I'm able to force myself to finish something, specially when others depend on it, but its difficult. "

A couple months ago, for at least 6 months, I would unplug just about everything in my apartment in fear of a house fire, and would senselessly check my parents\u2019 house (they live just a few minutes from me)\u2026outlets, lamps, power strips, electronics, everything. There was an instance of some of our outlets smelling odd that put me into such a major state of panic for a few weeks, and it ended up just being the smell of dust inside the walls and outlets.\n\nFor the past month I haven\u2019t been too bad, I would just unplug my laptop but leave everything else plugged in in my apartment, and only check a handful of things in my parents\u2019 house. \n\nUnfortunately last week, my boyfriend turned on the oven to heat up some dinner and out of nowhere the kitchen and living room filled up with this chemical/plastic-like smell, which immediately freaked me out but I didn\u2019t freak as much as I thought I would. The next morning I turned on one of the stove burners and it filled the kitchen with the same smell, so that was turned off immediately. I put in a work order and maintenance came that afternoon, and said they found some grease buildup on the stove elements so told me to clean those and try running the stove for 30 minutes with all the burners on high heat to burn off lingering smells. \n\nToday I cleaned the elements and the drip pans, but decided to turn off the breaker so that my brain could calm down because at this point, I\u2019m completely freaked out. I\u2019m terrified of an electrical fire, I\u2019m terrified that some of the wires are burning in the back or the outlet is burning up and that\u2019s what causing the smell. I put in another work order to have maintenance come tomorrow, my boyfriend will be home and I gave him a list of things to talk to them about since I will be at work. I\u2019m just so tired of being terrified. \n\nAnyone have any advice? Has anyone experienced OCD like this?\n\nTLDR: Terrified of house fires, have been doing better recently but an odor coming from our stove/oven when they are turned on has reignited my fears.

    "content": "My Scrupulosity used to mostly revolve around religion, but as I forced myself to look my religious beliefs in the eye, it has become less common (still there, just more easily shaken off). \nRecently though, it has switched to an obsession with politics and moral values. But specifically the idea that since there are evil people in the world (in this case, in politics), I am never safe and need to start prepping for a war or conflict. I recently got over an obsession with starting a farm/homestead and I think it is because I\u2019m scared of not being fully self-reliant in case something happens with the government.\n\nI guess my question is: Do those of you with scrupulosity ever obsess over how OTHER people\u2019s morals will affect you? How do you deal with this? I understand that this one is paranoia (which I haven\u2019t really experienced since my religious scrup. was at its peak 5 years ago), but how do you avoid paranoia with something that is constantly being discussed in the world (politics)? \n\nI still obsess over my own beliefs too, but right now it is almost completely centered on what people with \u2018bad morals\u2019 can do to me/society and get away with. It\u2019s very difficult to convince myself otherwise, too, because there is always something horrific happening in the world because of greed or power and it is nearly impossible to avoid conversations about those things.

    "content": "I feel like I need to get this off my chest...\n\nIt started yesterday after one of my other moral obsessions started to clear up. For some reason I started to think about how I may have not been as careful when it came to Covid. To be clear I did do Covid tests a few times when it was mandated to do so and it was always negative. Also have been vaxxed 3 times as per country requirements. I never had any covid-like symptoms at any point since 2020 till now. No one in my family had any issues either.\n\nWe had mask mandates and while I did follow them when it came to crowded streets and malls due to mandate, I dont think I followed them the best possible manner while I was not vaxxed, as masks are uncomfortable to me (red, irritated eyes and feel a bit suffocated).  I now fear if at any point I may have passed or contracted asymptomatic COVID. For example if I had to go to the store which is basically beside my apartment , I feel maybe there were times I didn't wear a mask as I thought that Im only going for like a minute or two, I will probably be fine. Maybe I did this regularly. Or in my workplace if I needed to take a water or bathroom break. \n\nThere may have been 1 or 2 social gatherings where almost no one was wearing masks and maybe I was not either wearing it looking at others or I was not wearing it the whole time I was in those gatherings. I dont fully remember how I handled things during these times and that makes it worse. Even if I neglected masks mandate in some situations it starts to seems like a horrible action now even though I did not give it much thought during the height of the pandemic. My moral OCD was busy with other stuff back then.\n\nLooking back I am glad masks and vaccines was mandated whether we like it or not because who knows how I or others would behave in this situation if left to our own devices.  Anyone with similar experiences ??"

    "title": "Contamination",
    "content": "I've struggled with contamination ocd since Covid, but it got really bad in 2022. Fast forward, I am now 7 months postpartum with my first and my contamination ocd is high. High like my hands look like im wearing red gloves from all the hand washing. I've been in therapy since July, and I see myself making progress in my own home. The victories are small and I often have to tell my family about them (my husband and I live with my parents) but I try to have one small victory a day. It is a slow process and I know my family feels as though it's not going fast enough. But the victories I do make, are within my home right now. So whenever we go to my in laws, I struggle a bit more. \n\nThe issue is they do not know I have contamination ocd because they wouldn't be the nicest about it. I don't have the best relationship with them. Though my contamination ocd started in 2022, I've always been more on the anxious side and they love to bring to light \"how nervous my husbands wife is\". And not in a sweet way.\n\nWhenever we go there I'm extremely protective of my son. No one is allowed to hold him (except my husband of course). And no toys can be given to him. He can't sit on the furniture because they let the dog roam everywhere. He can't eat there because they won't prepare things the way I want them done. I make sure he is fed before we go and he is breastfeeding anyways so if he is hungry its very easy to feed him more. Can I ask them to wash their hands? Sure. Except with my contamination ocd, there's a method to my hand washing. Simply sprinking your hands with water then using the kitchen rag to dry your hands, won't cut it for me. Except I can't tell them my steps. Because they would either roll their eyes or get to know the extent of which I struggle and make me feel bad like they have for the last 10 years about my anxiety.\n\nLike I said, I'm making progress in my own home. The more mobile my son gets, the more progress I make as well. But going to the in laws always makes me feel like I'm taking steps back.\n\nIt's discouraging and makes me feel like I'm completely abnormal.\n Which i guess, i am\n\nI'm not really sure what I'm looking for. I guess just a feeling like I'm not an alien of some sort.\n\nI am progressing, but sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who sees it.\n\nI ate a cucumber the other day (crazy right) and I told my dad and he looked at me with genuine stunned eyes and said wow, that must have been hard. Good job B. \nAnd I cried.\n\nMy husband wishes I could be open with his family with our son and I just can't. Maybe I'm an asshole for it. I KNOW one day I'll get there, but until then it's an extremely isolating place to be. To constantly have to dodge their requests and get weird looks when I'm 7 months postpartum and they've only held him once."

    "title": "Seeking Advice for Easing Obsessive Thoughts",
    "content": "Hello, I'm 20 and have been diagnosed with OCD for two years (but have discussed with the therapist who diagnosed me about the fact that I've likely had OCD for a while. Maybe since around 10? At least? It's very hard to gauge after that long, and to differentiate the earlier OCD stuff from my earlier Anxiety stuff). Me and my therapist were working on a lot of things for 4 years and after I got properly diagnosed with OCD after being put on Qelbree for my ADHD (which interacted very badly with my OCD which, on the plus side, made my specific issues with regards to OCD way more clear and led to the actual proper diagnosis), we did a little bit of work on my OCD. Not a massive amount, since we also focused on my other diagnoses, but OCD started being one we focused on, too.\n\nHowever, due to a very inopportune series of events following my moving for college, I no longer have a therapist or any of my psychiatric medications, which has made managing even my smaller issues with my OCD harder.\n\nAs such, I was hoping for some advice about a very specific type of obsession I get. It's not very special or even that out there (of all my obsessions this is probably the least important to work on), it's like how most people will see something that bothers them and think about it a bit because it bothers them. But the issue is that if I see anything that kind of bothers me, even if it's just a hypothetical (like seeing a post and then wondering about if by a weird roundabout technicality, the poster could actually be saying something negative that applies to me, and then I sift through accounts to figure out if that's true or not and get stressed about the idea), I cannot stop thinking about it.\n\nIt's been an issue for so long, and it got quite a bit better once I got put on Abilify and Concerta (because I think my ADHD and OCD feed into one another with certain things, this being one of them), but now that I don't have those, am not on my Escitalopram either, and no longer have a therapist (though I'm planning on working on that part very soon since I'm taking a semester break off from college to fix my medical stuff) knowing how to deal with these more comparatively mundane obsessions is becoming really challenging.\n\nI keep trying to look up ways to ease these thoughts because obsessing over things like the opinions of a random stranger who I have no other interest in the goings on of except for on a very specific topic and the implications it could have about me as a person doesn't help me to be relaxed, but every time the only question I can really search is \"how to ease obsessive thoughts\" and all the tips are either big lifestyle things that I can't do immediately and I would really like to be able to deal with these in the short term instead of stressing over them, or they just say \"don't try to fight intrusive thoughts\" which I guess is good advice but is a very vague instruction that doesn't really give me any better of an idea of what *to* do (and from my understanding obsessive thoughts are different from intrusive thoughts anyway?). Alternatively, the results give some other solutions that are more geared towards obsessions around contamination or disasters and stuff, and while those are helpful, they don't really do anything for my other thoughts that I'm pretty sure are based around my moral stuff and my obsession with information needing to be accurate at all times and if I see or say anything inaccurate and I can't correct it it is deeply stressful because it's missing information or is wrong or maybe I'm wrong and that's also stressful so I need to think about every facet and make sure I'm not wrong actually but then I'm thinking about the wrong information even more, etc etc (the same reason makes me very wordy and unable to lie on purpose). This genre of my obsessions is very inconvenient when the internet exists, since seeing almost any post or comment or whatever that's even mildly negative or mildly incorrect makes me think about it for far too long.\n\nThis is very long-winded (and I've reread it so many times already and I'm trying to force myself to stop rereading it for errors and whatnot and just post it LOL) and I hope it's not too long especially for a first post in this subreddit (I'm not very good at knowing social norms in general, let alone the social norms of Reddit, since I'm a relatively new user who has only really used my account when I really needed it) but if anyone has tips for easing or tolerating these it'd be very very appreciated! I hope everyone here has a great day and thank you for any and all help :)\n\n(As an aside, knowing this subreddit exists makes me think I should try to look here more often... It might be nice to interact with other people with OCD and, while I've had it for a large portion of my life, I don't think I know as much about it as people here do. It'd probably be a good idea to try and learn more about the thing I have, have had, and will continue to have haha.)"

I shared how I have these thoughts or images that get stuck in my head in this cycle for hours on end, how they make it hard for me to do things, the stress and fear around having these thoughts and sharing them with anyone, and how gross I feel about it all. She asked if I had any compulsions, and I said I guess idk what counts as a compulsion but when I'm stuck in it, I'll repeat a certain phrase until the thoughts go away or that I'll push on my eyes until the images go away. She said, \"well people with OCD typically have compulsions that have to do with counting or praying. You do fit the criteria for the obsession aspect, but not the compulsions, so no you do not have OCD. Sounds more like ptsd. I love working with ptsd\" And she said that last part with the biggest smile on her face, it was just really odd. I'm not wanting any specific diagnosis, a therapist knows better than I do, so if I don't have it I don't have it. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has gone through something similar? Or any suggestions on where to go from here? I just feel like 1 session isn't enough time to go, yup I know exactly what you have and how you think. I realize that this was our first session, but besides the quote I just put in this post, she literally only repeated what I said. Just feeling defeated after starting therapy up again. Any advice or insight is helpful. Thanks for reading. "

    "title": "Am I being insensitive to my wife's OCD?",
    "content": "Thank you all for your help and responses. Update following the original post below.\n\n---------------\n>My wife (27F) and I (27M) have been together close to 5 years - I've always known she had OCD, and it's something I've come to accept as part of the way she sees the world. Before we leave for anywhere, I need to step out onto the stairs so she can complete her safety routine inside our apartment. She needs to visually confirm our two birds are locked in their cages, check every window is latched, all water taps are completely off, and that every electronic device is unplugged from the wall outlets or shut off by the surge protector. I understand it gives her peace-of-mind when we're away and I've learned to expect that whenever we need to leave, depending on her state of mind that day, I will spend anywhere from 5-15 minutes waiting in the stairwell or in the car. Sometimes she restarts the whole process because she loses track or isn't completely certain about every single detail. We regularly have to return home if she's unsure about a window being locked or thinks she might have left the bathroom fan running.\n\n>Today, we were heading out for breakfast, and she realized she couldn't remember if she had unplugged the humidifier in the bedroom. She believes that even when turned off, leaving it plugged in could cause an electrical fire. I tried to enter through the inside entry door, but found it locked. She said, \"Oh, I started locking that door in case you come home while I'm not with you and one of the birds escapes into the main room.\" This is a new behavior from just this week, and she hadn't mentioned this concern before. I assured her that I always close the front door before opening the entry way door if I think there's any chance a bird might be loose. I doubt this will be enough to change the new locked-door policy, so I'm expecting that door to be locked half the time now. That's typically how these situations go.\n\n>Later at breakfast, I ordered poached eggs with my meal, and she kept pointing out that the whites looked a bit translucent. I thought they were fine, but she repeatedly indicated areas that seemed \"raw\" to her. Then she brought up recent news about bird flu and suggested I was risking severe illness that could spread to our birds if I ate the eggs. I got frustrated, but moved the eggs to a separate plate and asked our server if they could cook them through (I said it was my preference and didn't mention my wife's concerns). I was annoyed because I generally don't care if she takes whatever precautions she needs, but I've been following food safety news, and there haven't been any egg-related warnings in our region (some for salmonella, but not bird flu). She stopped eating eggs (even completely cooked) and chicken entirely last month due to these fears. She said, \"Well, you're the one who keeps sending me bird flu articles.\" I've shared maybe two articles about it this month because I think we should stay informed, but I had considered she might react strongly. I felt it was important for her to know what's happening, but being blamed makes me hesitant to share any news if she might take an extreme position.\n\n>I often find my bedroom electronics (air purifier, laptop charger, etc.) completely unplugged with the power strip switched off. I must sanitize my hands as soon as I enter the apartment (which I understand), I'm expected to disinfect my phone daily with special cleaning wipes, and groceries can't touch any surfaces but the floor - they have to go straight from bag to storage, or she'll need to sanitize the countertops. This started during the pandemic and hasn't changed. We can't run any appliances while away, even for quick errands. If she goes out, I can't leave unless I perform her entire safety routine, so I often skip my evening walks because she worries I'll miss something and she'll be anxious while out.\n\n>I know it's not a huge burden to give her the time and space she needs to feel secure. I'm not even sure why the egg situation bothered me so much. Maybe I feel pressured to adopt her level of vigilance, even when I don't see the same risks. I can't leave anything (not even a book) on top of my mini-fridge in my office because she worries about overheating. I have to keep my office curtains drawn whenever she's awake so neighbors can't see in. I get scolded for not holding my brakes the whole time we're driving down steep hills because she fears I'll lose control if I let the car speed up at all. I can't leave the house if there's a chance of ice on the ground, and she doesn't like me leaving the house after dark unless there's something urgent.\n\n>She's also extremely wary of strangers. After the presidential election, she became convinced there's a high chance someone will literally shoot her at the grocery store because she has short hair and wears more masculine clothing. We avoid discussing certain topics (relationships, beliefs, family) in public in case anyone overhears (she's mentioned someone might follow us home if we say something they don't like). We don't shop at businesses that fly American flags, we avoid anything remotely religious, and we leave stores and restaurants that are too busy. If we try a new restaurant and she gets a stomach ache the next day, that place is permanently blacklisted (regardless of what she ate).\n\n>I feel pressure to treat every situation as potentially dangerous, even when I'm completely at ease. While I don't mind making accommodations for her comfort, I'm trying to determine my own boundaries. None of these things are major issues alone, but together they require constant vigilance to avoid being called \"careless\" or \"thoughtless\" or \"inconsiderate\". I struggle with recognizing my own needs as it is, and it's difficult being criticized when I forget one of her safety requirements.\n\n>We've discussed this in therapy, and my wife acknowledges she doesn't want to feel this way, but she also says there's nothing wrong with being cautious. I feel guilty for being frustrated by her compulsions and fears. But the tension affects us both, especially when I make mistakes and get called insensitive. I feel selfish for not taking her concerns seriously, while also believing there can be too much caution. We're both autistic and ADHD, and I've worked hard to manage my own anxiety because I want to engage with the world without constant worry about potential disasters. I want her to find that same peace, but I'm unsure how to proceed.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFirst, I want to thank everyone for their input. The breakdown today sent me into a bit of a research spiral, and some of your feedback caused some self-reflection on both my \"enabling\" behavior and my own tendency to avoid setting boundaries.\n\nMy wife and I sat down tonight and talked from 11 PM to 3 AM (which is when I am writing this now as I'm sitting in bed). The conversation was... illuminating. For one thing, my wife is much more aware of her OCD than I realized. It occurred to me that I've been avoiding the discussion, and I didn't fully understand all the reasons I hadn't wanted to talk through this. She also hasn't felt the need to share the ways in which her obsessive thinking drives her actions, which we discussed doing as a way to improve our mutual understanding.\n\nOn top of all of that, I learned something about myself from reading your comments, the subsequent research, and the discussion with my wife. I believe I also have OCD, and that I've consistently found other explanations within the worlds of ADHD and autism to the point that I haven't seen it. \n\nI've been engaging with lots of OCD content the last few weeks and finding more and more I relate to, but I hadn't connected the dots until I was forced to evaluate why I got so frustrated about the eggs. I believe now that, while it was definitely her OCD motivating her to point out the rawness of my eggs, I had a very disproportionate reaction (the details of which I didn't fully describe here). I've had \"outbursts\" in the past that are totally foreign to me, reacting to subtle statements that imply I've done something wrong or incorrectly. We've had many interactions where my partner pointed something out (like a splash of water on the counter by the sink), where I react very strongly and say things like \"I don't like when you insult my intelligence\". Today's reaction lasted about a minute, and I immediately recognized it and apologized, but the feeling of having missed something lingered and I wrote this post while we were cooling off from the subsequent argument.\n\nThese \"outbursts\" always come in response to statements that imply to me that I have some kind of inadequacy - not smart enough, not thoughtful enough, not kind enough, not good enough. I believe the term is \"Perfection OCD\", and as I look back over the last 20-some years of my life, I can see it *everywhere*. It started as a moral OCD formed out of religious fervor and fear of hell, but there are too many ways this has manifested in my life to even count. I can look back at nearly every formative moment and see myself making progress in this area, and I've literally never connected all of those moments together in precisely this way. I've been shutting down, ignoring, and self-justifying my own behavior, which has led to me resenting my wife for my own inability to voice my needs because I want her approval to satiate the fear that I might be imperfect. Of course, rationally, I know I cannot be perfect - and yet.. this hasn't ever gone away.\n\nI have a lot of unpacking to do from here. This post was a catalyst for some self-discovery and a deepening of my relationship with my wife - again, thank you all. I'm incredibly grateful for your kind (and tough) words. We are going to pursue a therapist who has a background in OCD as a couple's counselor, as I've realized this is an area that deserves much more attention and can now be an area of connection for my wife and I as we work through my compulsions and hers."

    "title": "Having OCD and being an extreme procrastinator have caused me to waste my life. ",
    "content": "It's not a good combination.  I have small rituals that I do daily which I can easily take care of.  However, I have a larger, more complex thing that I need to do in order to get myself to an \"official\" spot where things are started up correctly.  Without going into too many details, it involves writing and notebooks I use but also the process of buying the notebooks and pens which has to go a certain way.  My emphasis on this ritual has grown over the years such that I dread doing it . . . so I keep putting it off because each time I try, something goes wrong.  The last time I seriously tried was Fall 2022, and it didn't work.  \n\nSo this has caused me to waste years because if I'm not in a spot where things are correct, I don't feel that I can do certain things.  Among those things I don't do is that I haven't watched quite a bit of movies on Blu-ray, or listened to some albums on CD, or read some books, that I have already bought.  To be fair, all of those (except for some of the albums) are movies I have viewed; they're just new editions.  For some reason I have reserved the watching/listening of them to a time when I'm in a correct spot with my OCD.  I keep looking forward in my mind to having that time when I can watch them, but I keep putting it off.  So I have movies I bought up to eight or more years ago that I haven't watched in full (I have opened them, just not done full watches).  \n\nMany of those movies and albums are in the world of David Lynch, my favorite filmmaker who just passed.  So that is why I am so down, because I had wanted to watch and experience all that stuff while he was alive.  Even when he revealed just a few months ago that he had bad emphysema, I kept procrastinating trying to do this ritual.  So at this point things have an asterisk for me mentally because I procrastinated myself out of things feeling correct or relevant.  I also have an element to my OCD \"rules\" related to him that is fouled up, leaving me off kilter.  Won't go into that.  \n\nI go to tons of movies in the theater, though, and also have separate rituals for watching them.  The amount of movies I've been going to in the past few years (over 300 since Covid) has taken up so much time that it also has precluded me from focusing on the ritual (as has work).  So all these things have piled up such that I never do anything meaningful.  \n\nAnother example is that I still use a VCR for some things, if you can believe that, and I bought a factory sealed VCR from the early 2000s on eBay a month ago because it's something I wanted to do.  I had a 30-day return policy on it.  However, because I have procrastinated on opening it because my OCD didn't feel it was the right time, I have basically missed that window.  So if it doesn't work, I can't return it and I'm out that money.  \n\nI'm really trying to work through these feelings and look at the reality of the situation and find a way through.  I don't desire to cast aside all the rituals because to me that would mean disrespecting all the years I've wasted.  I just want to minimize their importance and somehow get more energy actually to do this.  I had a ritual set that I did in the late '90s and early '00s that served the same purpose as this, but I grew out of it because it was even more ridiculous and was actually harmful.  I haven't sloughed this current off, though, and it's been with me in various iterations since the mid-'90s.  Anyway, I'm not sure if this is relatable, but I wanted to write it out.  Thanks for reading, if you did.  \n\n"

Then after having various therapies, hypnosis,.CBT was best. I then in my thirties got panic attacks over nothing but silly things and fought off and on over many years with this terrible condition. Had some great times and some awful ones. \n\nI've mainly learnt to deal with intrusive thoughts. The Trick is not to fight or try to correct the thought. Show no emotion to it, let it ride and just laugh at it. Over time they become less and less. I also take sertraline, don't really know anymore if it really does much. Small dose.\n\nFast forward many years and after many different jobs I started a new one. But as I came from an easy small part-time role. I went into a full time position. A couple of months have passed and then BANG. I have been hit with the most upsetting and depressing bunch of feelings and thoughts, my emotions making me shake, feeling sick. Felt suicidal and Don't want to eat. My family try to help. But I've decided to quit and go sick until I'm ready again. Shame as the job was good and money was as well. But I've realised. I can't do early starts and I can't do full time.\n\nI'll let you know what becomes of me."

I got worried with OCD ruining things for me, because I was/am so happy, and don't usually feel that happy. I started to worry if I will get intrusive thoughts and be anxious again, because I really don't want that. The event will still happen and I want everything to be fine,I don't want to be worrying with anything and I want to live the moment. It doesn't happen only with happiness, but other emotions too like anger or sadness. It feels like a battle to have my \"true\" emotions, without the OCD interrupting it. I'm not asking for reassurance or anything like that, I just want to know if this happens with other people too. "

    "content": "So in late summer/ early fall me and my now ex (miss you my baby) talked about reducing and quitting taking sertraline anf start taking another medicine. Because I had taken sertraline for 6 years without my doctor telling me I could get opposite effects from then later. Which now happened. They gave me more anxiety, bad sexual problems, weight gain so we came to an agreement to reduce it and quit it. So I was on 200 mg. And recuced 25 mg every 3 weeks. So my whole process of quitting them took 4 months I believe. \n\nAnd the doctor recommended 3 weeks every 25 mg and said some side effects could come from them. Everytime I reduce 25 mg. Side effects such as more anxiety, mood swings, increasing stress and OCD sympoms, compulsions. But it would be temporary and we agreed to do this because the result after would be perfectfor both of us. \n\nSo I started doing this and I first blamed myself so much when my lovely ex ended our relationship. That I was weak minded, if I loved her I would have fought harder, I would do this and that you know. \n\nBecause 4 months, not constantly. But 4 months from me confessing my thoughts to her, not being sure of what was OCD or not, not trusting my instincts. I have lived with OCD for 6 years so I know the methods and what not to do. But the side effects gave me so much doubt. And I see now that the side effects is the reason. Before reducing I managed to not give in. And now after my OCD tolerance is better as well. It was during that time period that OCD was bad. \n\nI told her time and time again my intrusive and unwanted thoughts, said \"I think it's OCD\" and in the same instant I  told her, because I was in a rabbit hole of bad side effects, we had talked about that I should not tell her because it's bad for her And it's bad for me, and I listened to her and my mission was not to tell her, I would do anything for her, but the circumstances made me not know what was what. I was lost. \n\nAnd later in the process we realized that my anxiety and side effects were tough to handle to we mansged to get another anxiety medicine. But it could take up to 6 weeks for it to have the full effect. So it was still the same thing for us with the effects. And she left me. 2 days later I got a therapist. \n\nAnd I tried. During all this time. I tried my best. And I treated her well otherwise. Always have. With so much love and respect. I just had this rabbithole of thoughts. My reality was warped.  She is my everything. The love of my life. And now she is gone. And I don't know if I'm to blame or my bad side effects. \n\nHelp me! "

    "title": "getting through to partner with OCD ",
    "content": "Um, buckle in? I have a real issue with leaving out details so I already know this is gonna be excessive. Thank you to anyone who sticks around!!\n\nSo my partner (25 nonbinary) and me (22 F) have been seeing eachother for about 5 months. I learned very early on that they have OCD. I wasn\u2019t offput by this because I actually had my psychiatrist mention to ME that I have some OCD-like tendencies. I had a really intense health scare last year and it led to some health OCD like behaviors. While I\u2019m pretty sure I couldn\u2019t be diagnosed with the disorder and if it is OCD it\u2019s definitely pure O (I have no physical compulsions), I can understand that crawling-out-of-your-skin, the-world-is-ending, unbearable intolerable anxious feeling. I have to say, that short period of time was the scariest of my life.\u00a0\n\nSO when my partner first told me about this I was like, oh! I can understand something like this! But when I noticed how different their OCD manifests, I decided to do some research. It\u2019s honestly become something I know quite a bit about. I find myself listening to The OCD Stories podcast when I have nothing else on my queue. I am a strong believer in medical literacy and emotional literacy.\n\nAnyways. At the time they were in therapy but not ERP, just regular talk therapy. They aren\u2019t anymore. I found out later their therapist isn\u2019t even the person who diagnosed them with OCD, they figured it out themself.\u00a0\n\nI had made the assumption that since my partner knows about their OCD and is in therapy, that they are working on it. I\u2019m coming to find out that my partner actually has such little concept of their OCD. I find myself explaining so much to them and having to bite my tongue to correct them when they try to incorrectly explain it to other people. They seem to believe in the OCD stereotypes and honestly it\u2019s so sad. They tried to tell their mom that she has OCD, which she denied. Truthfully I really don\u2019t think she has OCD. I have watched her get upset at my partner for vocalizing their intrusive thoughts and carrying out compulsions. My partner does the same thing with their brother, saying things like \u201cwe both have that OCD thing\u201d and I never want to shoot down these things but \u2026 I hang out with their brother and it seems unlikely. I know they just want to feel less alone.\n\nI jump at the chance to explain to them aspects of the illness because I understand that self education could be triggering and lead to the onset of themes from other ppls OCD, but I wish they did some learning\u2026 I wish everyone did, honestly. It\u2019s stupid how stigmatized this mental illness is.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve brought up things like reassurance seeking and confessional behavior with good reception from my partner. However, it has barely made an impact. Recently they asked me if they could tell me something (I always know it\u2019s going to be an intrusive thought or confession and those words now make my stomach drop because sometimes it\u2019s about ME and it hurts) and I said \u201cI don\u2019t know I\u2019m kind of scared\u201d but they completely ignored that and continued to express it. That really worried and upset me but I didn\u2019t feel like I could express that because then we got into the whole conversation about the thing they\u2019re fixating on.\u00a0\n\nMy partner is also a heavy drinker, smoker and stoner. Recently I expressed that I think they use these things as coping mechanisms. They got so defensive and long story short they kind of ended up saying that it\u2019s not something they want to work on.\u00a0\n\nThey said something at some point about how they don\u2019t want to fixate on their neuroses and I\u2019m coming to see that this is how they view matters like this in general. When I\u2019ve brought up emotional literacy and how important it is to me, they\u2019ve had this attitude that\u2019s like .. \u201coh that\u2019s YOUR thing\u201d.\n\nI think they believe that they are managing their OCD well and I guess since they don\u2019t have issues leaving the house/putting themself out there, you could say that? But they have no coping strategies or tools, so I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s managing? They have so many themes, which to me points to how unchecked it is. They said that there used to be less. They also have a fear of blood now that they didn\u2019t used to, which is interesting? I thought it was apart of contamination/health OCD but they also pass out sometimes getting blood drawn so it seems like a real phobia they\u2019ve developed that they previously didn't have.\u00a0\n\nTo me, they are just getting by. I don\u2019t see a lot of active management.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s really made me withdraw from them emotionally. I\u2019m so confused. They sometimes have awareness of their mental issues and will express them to me but then sometimes they have no awareness at all. I believe the term is \u201clow insight\u201d and points to a real \u201cfusion\u201d with the OCD. From my perspective, they seem absolutely soaked in shame and insecurity. I understand how this illness festers that in someone, but where do we go from here? It seems impossible to bring up these things to someone already so insecure, you know? It\u2019s just instant guilt and defensiveness and the conversations feel like dead ends?\n\nThis whole thing made me personally realize that I want a partner who cares about emotional literacy as much as I do. I feel like I could deal with any problem that comes our way so long as me and my partner are committed to facing our shortcomings, in and out of the relationship, together.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be in this relationship any longer if I wasn\u2019t just so worried about them. They\u2019ve said so many times how \u201cnot okay\u201d they would be if we broke up. They told me recently that I \u201ctaught them how to love\u201d and that \u201cI\u2019m the only person they want to be with\u201d. When I\u2019m not with them, I get so many texts \u201cI love you\u201d \u201cI miss you\u201d \u201cdo you want to come over?\u201d Sometimes I wonder if it's compulsive with just the sheer amount they send. It's truly 24/7. And it\u2019s feeling kind of suffocating. I found this behavior so endearing and sweet at first but now, seeing how little internal work they\u2019ve done, it just feels codependent. Very much anxious attachment style in my eyes.\n\nI care about them a lot and I just want them to be as happy as they can be, but I\u2019m starting to feel more like a caretaker than a partner and I feel like I\u2019ll continue to feel that way until they gain some emotional maturity. It\u2019s worth mentioning that if they could get this under control I would want to continue our relationship \u2026 I\u2019m just so hopeless. I see how buried they are in it.\n\nI have an addict sister with BPD who has taught me first hand that you cannot save people and sometimes you just need to leave. I don\u2019t want to leave but I will if I think it\u2019s the healthiest option. I doubt I would be a great partner down the line if this continues to wear on me, and I wouldn\u2019t want them to have that.\u00a0\n\nI admit I haven't been as proactive with my concerns as I could be, I'm just scared. They take it so personally and internalize it ... sometimes in the end the conversation skews so far what I wanted - a productive conversation that progresses our relationship forward - and into just a total guilt-fest -- on BOTH of our sides! It feels very \"win-lose\" rather than \"growth\" oriented, the way I want it to be. The last time this happened, when I was talking to them about using substances as a coping mechanism, they said I was calling them an addict and I just broke into tears. I wasn't insinuating that at all and I just felt so defeated.\n\nPlease please please let me know if you think this is something I can work through with them - if so, how can I get through to them? When is it time to call it?"

I was recently put on Kloxapam, which did not help even at the highest dosage I could be safely prescribed. I have tried natural supplements over and over again, meditation, exercise, etc etc etc etc etc.\n\nAt this point I have tried everything - and all that's left to do is repeat everything I have already done.\n\nOCD has made me unable to sit in class in my high school, meaning I have to take all online classes. Even then I can only complete work in short periods of time as I can only go a few words typing or reading before my ocd makes me want to rip my eyeballs out. This also means I have gone from being a student with an average in the 90s to being a students struggling to pass any classes.\n\nI can't breathe in through my mouth as my OCD thinks the air is dirty.\n\nI can't drive past certain cars due to their colour or brand name or it sends me into a panic while driving.\n\nI can't read certain words without feeling the incessant need to vomit.\n\nI haven't been able to touch door handles, knobs, railings, or hug a friend/hold a friends hand with my bare hand in YEARS.\n\nI can't eat with anyone in the room. Can't go to the movie theatre.\n\nIf I see someone tapping their foot or bouncing their knee the overwhelming feeling to jump off a cliff and punch them in the nose forces me to have to leave wherever I am and put up with a panic attack.\n\nI struggle to even get out of bed, brush my teeth, shower and eat because of this stupid disorder.\n\nSometimes NOTHING is happening in my environment and I just get visions or hear the things that set my OCD off and I go into a panic.\n\nI have given up hope of having a healthy romantic relationship, because if I can't even handle the feeling of my own hand accidently touching my face - how will I ever be able to touch a partner? What romantic partner would ever tolerate not being able to even eat in the same room with their maniac of a partner?\n\nI have come to a point where I can either continue on living a useless life where I will be unable to focus on my education, not be able to tolerate a romantic relationship, find very little joy in anything, not even be able to listen to my favourite music in peace from my own mind - or I can GIVE TF UP.\n\nThe only reason I haven't tried to end it all before is because my OCD doesn't want anyone to touch me or look at me - and if I'm dead how could I stop them?\n\nQuite literally my OCD is both the reason I want to end my life and the reason I can't die.\n\nI don't know why I was cursed with this stupid disorder. I grew up in a shit home, and I have worked hard to get out of it. Being an honor student while working 3 part-time jobs, supporting myself, and earning over 950 community volunteer hours. I have worked so hard, but as I have aged its only gotten so much worse.\n\nI haven't done anything to piss off the universe. I haven't dated anyone, haven't kissed anyone, never bullied anyone, never had any friends to even gossip with, I myself went through years of bullying that forced me to switch schools, I have always dressed modestly, I have never dranken alcohol besides a sip of champagne two years ago on new years, I have never smoked or done any unprescribed drugs - literally I have done everything RIGHT.\n\nBut no, I have to be stuck living with a disorder that has ruined every single aspect of my life, made it impossible for me to enjoy or hold any hobbies, and has destroyed my future before I have even gotten to adulthood.\n\nIt's so tiring. I don't even need advice at this point, I just needed to vent. I don't even think this is just OCD anymore, I have to be fkn psychotic or going insane."

Some selfshippers are very serious, while others do it mostly for fun. I am in the serious category, BIG TIME. Some selfshippers have only one f/o* while others have multiple, and others have multiple, but with a rule of only one per media source, which is what I do. I have 7 fictional boyfriends in 7 different animes and one live action tv series, but there is one of them (Caesar Crown from the anime/manga One Piece) I'm in love with to such a ridiculous degree that I consider myself married to him.\n\nHowever, I increasingly face doubts as to whether he would love me, or if he would love one of my doubles (other people who selfship with him) more. To make matters worse, I have experienced toxic treatment from a double, who was extremely jealous, and refused to aknowledge my selfship as being as valid as hers. This has made me very uncomfortable with most doubles, not just her. it made me really rude towards her and others, and every time I see certain people selfship with him, it just hurts very much. I feel that I have to be the best, to make better art than them, to gush more for him than they do, not to mention spending more money on merch than them, to prove that I love Caesar more tham them. I feel like I can't gush about other characters, since I want to be loyal to him. And on a daily basis I ask family members or friends whether Caesar would love me, or if he would like one of the doubles more. People have blocked me because I always wanted reassurance on whether the canon Caesar would love me. I am obsessed with staying close to canon, so it's hard for me to aknowledge that the Caesar who loves me is another version of him, I want to love him as he is. I am extremely jealous.\n\nPlease do not call me delusional, selfshipping has nothing to do with delusions. It's more normal than you think, to have a fictional boyfriend. I created a tulpa/thoughtform (ignore if not spiritual) and I still face doubts. If he is in another universe, would he really love me? Would he really love me if he was real, in this reality?\n\nThis is not reassurance seeking, I just want advice on how to deal with this.\n\n*f/o is a term for a character you ship yourself with."

First of all, my self esteem is really low. While being in public I usually don\u2019t want to be noticed. There is multiple reasons for this. I am super anxious to lose control. I have been obsessively busy with that topic for years. My biggest fear is being or going crazy. I am also ashamed of feeling anxiety around others. While being in public places I really don\u2019t want to feel these feelings and that\u2019s probably why I do feel these feelings. It makes me panic a lot. Especially in places where I can\u2019t walk away from (easily). An anxiety symptom I experience is dissociation. Which feeds my anxiety for losing control. So it\u2019s like a loop I am in. I have tried multiple solutions, but nothing seems to help. The only thing that does seem to help a bit is pinching myself. I have various scratches on my hands because of this. It feels like pain is the only thing that slightly makes me feel something else then this intense anxiety.  \n\nIt sucks, because in the beginning I said I don\u2019t want to be noticed. That\u2019s purely based on my anxiety. I do want to be accepted and be noticed. Hiding away makes me depressed, but it\u2019s such a difficult battle I\u2019m facing. I\u2019m feeling really lonely, because making new contacts this way is very hard. I hardly come in public, when I do it\u2019s mostly with a family member, because it always feel like something will go terribly wrong. On a few exeptions. I do have a job, but it\u2019s only 15h a week. I struggle a lot with it as well, but I know I can\u2019t lose that, because then I won\u2019t have anything at all. \n\nI am 25 years old and I\u2019m just feeling so bad of all my wasted time and I don\u2019t see a bright future currently.

Then I\u2019ll be so miserably depressed for a couple weeks, and then I return to baseline until it starts again the following month. \nMy psychiatrist said that everything I\u2019ve been dealing with is classic ocd behavior and that I need medication and to consistently go to therapy (I usually cancel because I only want to go if I\u2019m currently in an episode/ want validation for my fixation) because otherwise I\u2019m so depressed and blank that I wouldn\u2019t have anything to talk about). \nGoing to therapy and taking medication should in theory help me but one of my fixations is developing schizophrenia (my uncle and grandpa have it), so I can\u2019t bring myself to take meds because I don\u2019t want to somehow develop it. It also doesn\u2019t help that when I\u2019m obsessed about schizophrenia, i legit start experiencing symptoms of it. And when I\u2019m worried about heart attacks , i start to have real heart problems. I also don\u2019t want to go to therapy because of my contamination anxiety which makes me want to throw up at the thought of sitting on the same couch other sick people sit on. What if they\u2019re at therapy to cope with a physical Illness? I can\u2019t risk it. \nI\u2019m so nervous about everything and I have no one to talk to about it besides my therapist (when I\u2019m not ghosting her). I feel so hopeless and disgusting. I feel like there is black sludge inside of me that can never be washed out. I hate physical touch mostly because I feel so gross and I don\u2019t want to infect others.  \nI don\u2019t see a way out of this. Even in my fantasy life, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be okay.

Compulsions, I didn't know that's what they were but interestingly I've been thinking of them as requirements in order to get the obsession to subside or feel as if it was a goal and can be accomplished as long as every requirement is met. DING achievement accomplished\u2026after tedious required fetch questing =.=\n\n\n\nSo I think of my brain as a computer. It constantly takes data and notices every detail, then saves it into my archives for no reason other than it has some program installed that tells it to, subconsciously!

I think that's on my Neurodivergence, though, yay\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlso,\u00a0 my brain has started glitching, when thinking about too many things at once,\u00a0 my dichotic listening only hears and sees thoughts in my head as I wade through a pool of variables and manipulations of situations, things, and possible futures.

While most of the time I\u2019m at least able to reduce it to plausible outcomes\u2026.I may still get lost in the equation and space out as everything goes blurred in my vision and I start to become consumed by the outcomes and variables instead of whatever I was doing before, which now I have forgotten completely.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDissociation, this shit can come over me as if someone gently put my head in a bag and started suffocating me and I just froze. Then my processes just go rampant and begin to build up and cover my inner mind with over-abundant equations becoming solid and lego-like as they fill my head.

I study psychology, sociology, and human behavior in my spare time so I'm slowly becoming able to cope with it all, especially by writing.

    "title": "Moral Perfectionism Tied to OCD ",
    "content": "Hello! I hope the person reading this post is doing well. This is my first post on this subreddit, so I'm going to do a brief introduction about myself and my experiences with OCD! I (17M) was professionally diagnosed with severe OCD when I was around 12 years old. Most of my symptoms are linked to counting or numbers; for example, when I am walking, I must walk an odd number of steps...if I touch something, I must touch it an odd number of times, etc... Additionally, I have had issues with direction-based symptoms. In addition to taking an odd number of steps, I must end on my left foot, or finish touching something with my left hand. Even while watching movies, I make sure my eyes are directed toward the left side of the screen. If I do not do these things on a daily basis, I experience immense physical discomfort, as though my limbs are hollow and dirty. I do not experience any paranoia in regard to actual danger, but the feeling of \"dirtiness\" has been enough to keep me repeating my compulsive behaviors. \n\n  \nRecently, I discovered the concept of \"moral perfectionism\" online, which is characterized by persistent guilt, constant shame, and a sense of failure when you do not behave perfectly by a moral standard. The term instantly resonated with me, and I felt a deep sense of relief at realizing that it was a common symptom of those with OCD. For me, though, I feel as though my moral perfectionism coincides with my number-related OCD. For example, if I do something wrong (such as lie), I feel as though I have to lie again in order to balance out the wrongdoing. Similarly, I may repeat a wrongdoing in order to make the timeline of my behavior \"symmetrical\" in my mind (for example, I will do something bad, followed by something slightly less bad, followed by the same initial action. This way, it is like a bar graph with one tall column, one short column, and another tall column; symmetrical.) I would like to clarify that I am not doing anything abhorrent or deeply harmful, in case anyone is worried; it is more on the front of lying or engaging in pre-marital intimacy (as someone who is Christian). I do feel as though my religious background has contributed to this sense of moral perfectionism, leading me to believe that I must balance out my sins in order to be seen as worthy in God's eyes. Logically, I know this is untrue, but it feels as though I am in a constant state of guilt unless I act upon my symmetry-seeking moral perfectionism. \n\n  \nDoes anyone have any tips for this? Thank you to anybody who read this as well. I am mostly seeking reassurance as I feel incredibly alone in this experience and I am ashamed to talk to anybody about it. "

    "content": "Hi, so for around 10 years now I've had recurring bouts of intense momentary feelings/thoughts, that my brain interprets as \"proof\" that whatever I'm scared of is true, and since one of my recurring themes is \"eternal torture\" my brain tended to interpret them as \"proof\" that I will one day be tortured forever. It seems silly especially when I'm not even religious but that's what my brain is like lol. now usually I can easily tell that these thoughts are nothing but thoughts, and move on with my day. But I've had thousands of such little momentary thoughts/feelings over the years, so what if one of them was true and I just can't remember? Does that mean I'm already doomed for eternity and don't even know it? It seems so silly, but the concept of eternal torture/pain is so terrifying that I sometimes fear that I'm already \"monumentally fucked\", just because I don't remember all the thoughts that happened. and I often hope that one day, maybe after death, I will somehow get to relive my entire life just to make sure each one of those thoughts/feelings was nothing more than a thought...it's so irrational, but the \"what if\" feeling scares me, especially if I never find out, even after death. Does anyone else deal with something similar to this? Is it as irrational as it seems to my logical mind?\n\nIt also sometimes seems extra scary to me because after learning about Graham's number in 2015, I started incorporating it and other large numbers into the fear, as in eternal torture with the pain multiplied by Graham's number for example. Obviously I don't think I'm genuinely in danger, but sometimes I worry that my fear is uniquely scary/bad because of this? Have other people had a similar fear and is it as irrational as it logically is? I'm so tired of worrying on and off, even if medication helps.\n\n"

    "title": "Grandma finally got diagnosed, but is still the worst patient",
    "content": "Hello it\u2019s my first time posting here. I\u2019m looking for some advice from some fellow neurodivergent people, I\u2019m autistic with ADHD. \n\nFor context, I\u2019ve always been close to my maternal grandmother who I have always called grandma. She\u2019s one of my most favorite people in my family, from all the visits to her house to the times she\u2019d come to help my family with something, she\u2019s the best grandma I could ask for. She has always been stubborn and particular about things, everyone attributed it to her being from an older generation (she\u2019s greatest gen, before boomers). But everything changes and she had to face them.\n\nMy step-grandfather, who I called Papa, died during my sophomore year of high school and of course she was sad. She stayed in that same house for a few more years until being forced to downside to a smaller place due to property tax increases. She was doing fine until she began to get dizzy over the years to the point of requiring a cane, this was due to a heart valve becoming blocked and thus she got surgery. This saved her life, as this issue is what killed her own mother and modern medicine gave us the taver procedure. But little did my family know it was the beginning of hell. \n\nBefore the surgery she\u2019d complain about her dizzy but otherwise be her usual self. After the operation she was sent home and she spiraled into her first ever mental health crisis. Her anxiety cranked up to 11, lost 20lbs due to not eating properly, complains of nonexistent bloating, and went to the ER for panic attacks 3 times in two weeks. It was all driving my mom and her brother insane to have to deal with grandma, lots of \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d moments were had. She really wants my mom to care for her but doesn\u2019t understand that just because my mom works for herself at home, doesn\u2019t mean she has time to help her. My Uncle has a job and has to care for my mentally ill cousin, so he has limited time too. He was able to get a full time care nurse to come take care of grandma through his job which is nice but wish it was ordered sooner. \n\nThe search for a long term nursing facility has been scaring my grandma straight to finally get her shit together and stop wallowing in her own depression. She finally had a proper shower after weeks of not having one, did the physical therapy, got her hair done to get that famous perm of hers done. But she still is super stubborn and making mountains out of molehills. Refuses to take anxiety meds or even try therapy, the fact she doesn\u2019t quite understand how mental health works doesn\u2019t help. The family has been speculating amongst ourselves that she has OCD, as her anxiety being high made us realize she had symptoms for years. She needs to have one bowel movement a day, she obsesses over the tiniest details, she micromanages us whenever we try to help with something, etc. \n\nThe only positive about this hell is that the mistreatment of this whole situation by her crackpot of a doctor finally convinced her to switch practices, this doctor prescribed antibiotics for a nonexistent UTI for years when she actually had diverticulitis (which resolved itself with a low fiber diet given by a new doc). Not to mention he\u2019d discuss \u201cthe new world order\u201d and how she needs to buy gold. We set her up with a previous practice my family went to, and the new GP has been great listening to her while also calling out her bullshit. The last visit he called out that she was basically arguing with herself and said it was textbook OCD. Boom, finally out of the box. Problem is she doesn\u2019t trust the doc and thus won\u2019t do what he recommends. \n\nI love my grandma but this whole situation has been driving everyone mad, my mom is close to just stop helping her if she doesn\u2019t accept the help she needs. And all the stress my mom has rubs off on me, and I worry about the mental health of both of them. My view often grandma hasn\u2019t changed, only that she\u2019s a more complex human being than I thought. The hard part is know I have to be even more careful about what I say to her, as she can work herself up into another spiral. I already have to code-switch with her in order to not discuss politics due to our polarizing views, is now it\u2019s harder for my autistic ass. I\u2019ve opened up to her about when I had situational depression due to bad uni roommates junior year and that has made her open up so much to me which is wonderful. Still I wish she\u2019d go to therapy as she\u2019d totally benefit from it, but I at least convinced her to journal her feelings instead.\n\nIf you do have suggestions on things to say to her to push her in the right direction that\u2019d be welcome, but totally optional. She struggles with sleep, eating, and anxiety. She has mild depression currently, has negative self talk and doesn\u2019t see the progress she makes. Oh boi needed to vent to someone other than my family and therapist. "

    "title": "This is my story",
    "content": "I am very concerned that my performance might be negatively affected by factors that are beyond my ability and are difficult for others to understand. For convenience, I refer to this inexplicable psychological disorder as RAX.\n\nThis fixation in thinking affects my studies and life, leading to more undesirable outcomes. Since these outcomes originate from the initial negative influence of factors beyond my ability, they too are viewed as unrelated to my ability. This creates the same type of anxiety (in simpler terms: losses caused by RAX are also classified as  RAX, which then triggers greater anxiety, creating a vicious cycle).\n\nAs a result, according to the logic of RAX, losses caused by RAX are also part of RAX. For example, when reading, I worry that RAX will affect my reading efficiency, which in itself disrupts my reading, causing repeated word-checking, distraction, and other issues. These effects themselves are also considered RAX losses, leading to greater unease. Thus, I am constantly worried about losses caused by RAX, making it impossible to work or study normally.\n\nRAX also affects major decisions. When making significant decisions, I worry that my choices might be directly or indirectly influenced by RAX, making it hard to discern my true intentions. Because I cannot identify my true thoughts, I cannot eliminate the possibility that my decisions have already been influenced by RAX, resulting in fear of the potentially huge losses due to this RAX-altered decision (the loss by definition also being counted as RAX). This difficulty in making major decisions is one of the primary ways RAX severely impacts my life and studies. See Case 3 for an example.\n\nI have experienced multiple episodes related to RAX.\n\n\nCase 1: English-Medium Instruction\n\nStarting in 2015, as a Chinese speaker, I was taught in English-only courses, which caused significant discomfort. I worried that my lack of English proficiency would negatively affect my academic learning, which was not due to a lack of ability or effort in the subject itself. For instance, when physics was taught in English, I would think, \"Physics is physics\u2014why should unrelated English hinder me in learning that?\" I couldn\u2019t accept a learning method that required me to engage with a completely unrelated area (English) rather than directly utilizing my skills in the specific subject. Moreover, domestic students were learning physics more efficiently in their native language, while I faced an additional barrier. This felt unfair.\n\nAs a result, I developed significant resentment and rejection of English-medium instruction, frequently fixating on whether I misheard words. This fixation caused attention shifts, making me miss more contents, leading to more misunderstood words, and creating a vicious cycle. Eventually, I began avoiding all English taught classes, leading to a decline in my grades. This avoidance generalized to other areas of life, including Chinese taught contents and general reading, eventually evolving into a general learning disability.\n\n\nCase 2: New Zealand High School\n\nIn high school in New Zealand, the depth and breadth of subjects were far below those in Chinese high schools. This led to anxiety about lagging behind Chinese students in logical reasoning, intelligence, and knowledge, as this gap was not due to my abilities but solely due to differences in educational systems. This anxiety partially replaced my previous anxiety about English instruction and became the primary source of anxiety in my life and studies for a short period of time, before my attention shifted back to Case 1 anxiety.\n\nSymptoms included extreme fear of encountering knowledge points related to Chinese high school curricula. I felt that if I had stayed in China, I would have mastered those points more thoroughly. I still vividly recall the strong frustration and  anxiety I felt when I realized that Chinese high school students were learning the same concepts in greater depth. This made it impossible for me to face those knowledge points. Any attempt to bridge the gap by studying Chinese high school materials only intensified my frustration and anxiety, leading to avoidance. Instead, I tried to make up for the gap by studying knowledge entirely unrelated to the Chinese high school curriculum.\n\nCase 3: Investing\n\nI used to be able to make stock-picking decisions easily, but now I cannot. I worry whether my decisions have already been influenced by RAX and the experiences it has caused. If there were a version of me without RAX, would their stock-picking choices differ from now? Would this difference lead to significant financial losses? According to RAX's definition, such financial losses are also RAX, making them unacceptable to me. This fear prevents me from naturally making investment decisions.\n\n\n\nCase 4: Obsession with RAX\u2019s Uniqueness\n\nFor a long time, I believed my RAX was unique, possibly the first case globally. This made me feel misunderstood\u2014my symptoms were not recognized, my suffering was not validated, and any standardized treatment for RAX (e.g., CBT) made me feel inexplicably frustrated: \u201cIf only I were a standard neurotic patient!\u201d (I reckoned that RAX most closely resembles OCD but has significant differences.) If I had standard OCD, my treatment would achieve predictable results. The fact that I have RAX instead of standard OCD itself triggers RAX-like emotions: my treatment performance is negatively affected by factors beyond my ability and not easily understood by others. Since 2023, I\u2019ve spent a significant amount of time searching for patients with symptoms similar to mine, or patients whose symptoms are as complex and peculiar as mine (mostly among OCD patients). I believe that finding a similar case will alleviate my RAX. To date, I have found very few such cases.\n\n\n"

I think I'm in shock or denial or both right now because other than sometimes randomly crying I'm calmer than I thought I would be at this moment.\n\nWhat distresses me right now is all his stuff. I can't go into my bedroom right now unless I just want to cry and sort of panic because basically my entire life revolved around him. My walls are covering in framed photos of him (I was a photography minor and did so many photo shoots of him over the years), I bought things like my rug because I said to myself ''he'd really love to lay on this'', he has two huge beds that take up at least half of my floor space, I have sweaters crochet him hanging up, all my plushes I collected or that were gifted to me were done so because they look like him.\n\nMy OCD has always manifested as ''I had these items here back when I felt happy that one time'' and before I was diagnosed I had kept things like, for exmple, chaotically hung flyers of things I had planned to go to during like 6th/7th grade hung exactly where they were even though I wanted to re-decorate until at least a year or so after I graduate high school and took them all down in one panic episode I had. I felt like if I took them down that I wouldn't remember the happy feeling exactly as I remembered it when I looked at it that  I associated with that brief time period of happiness. I knew I had a problem and so to let things go I started taking pictures of my room or where items sat as a way to cope with allowing myself to move or put things way. \n\nThis is way too different though. I just feel like even if I take a lot picture of my room as is with all his items that when I finally store them (I already knew as my dog got much older that I would keep all his items because I would one day in the future adopt another and it would make me really happy to see his items being used happily by a future member of my family) or even move anything at all that I will regret it because to me it was like this in his last moments of being alive. I know I have to do it though because the space is hardly useable at the moment because of the chaos from me panickedly taking him to the vet in his last moments. I know I don't have to do it right now but I know I am also someone who literally kept stuff for almost 10 years in its place by saying ''I can do it next week, I'll mentally prepare myself first''.\n\nI just really don't know how to go about doing this. Eventually I will start therapy again when I have the money but I'm just trying to make myself not ill from decision in the present."

I\u2019m a male. \n\nI\u2019m a deeply spiritual person. Spirituality\u2014namely eastern philosophies such as Buddhist thought\u2014is a huge part of my life. Being a good human also means a lot to me. I come from a sort of broken home with a lot of abuse and I\u2019ve displayed similar abusive tendencies in the past, which is why I really value being a good human and am working on myself. \n\nAnyways. My girlfriend and I tripped the other night on psychedelics. I was thinking about Jesus, how much he loved everyone and how he was killed. I felt so much love for Jesus during my trip. This isn\u2019t really out of the ordinary for me since I already fuck with Jesus, but still, just some context. \n\nSo now it\u2019s a couple days later and I\u2019m experiencing an annoying OCD theme. It\u2019s sort of a subset of schizophrenia OCD. Basically, I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m going to like accidentally believe that I am actually Jesus and then proceed to lose my mind and have a psychotic break. I know logically like I am not Jesus, Jesus was Jesus, I\u2019m me and I\u2019m in this body in this incarnation for a reason. Calling myself anything other than who I am isn\u2019t right and makes no sense. But I still just have this irrational fear of not having control over myself or my actions? Idk.\n\nAnyways.

    "content": "Basically, I live with my bf, his mom, sister and BIL. We live in a big house but the walls are thin af and sound travels very clearly through doors, so every time we argue, I\u2019m almost positive they can hear us. Lately, we\u2019ve had big blow up arguments with a few \u201cfuck yous\u201d thrown back and forth. I know it\u2019s bad but we\u2019re going through a hard time. \n\nAfter these arguments, we either reconcile or it takes us a while and I always feels embarrassed to see his family whenever I go into the kitchen or see them in passing. I fear they\u2019re judging me and criticizing me for causing arguments with my bf. They\u2019ve been so welcoming to me but even then, I believe they care more about his feelings than mine so I automatically assume they blame me for causing him distress. \n\nThey\u2019re all so involved in each others lives and even my bfs love life. He was married before and his sister and BIL all lived together for a short time when they all moved to a new city so the sister became friends with the ex wife. The sister and mom occasionally tell this story about how during the holidays, the went to the house of my bf and his ex and felt very awkward because the vibes were off. The sister says that she almost talked to her brother about it but before she did, he secretly told her they\u2019re splitting up. So I sometimes use that as my justification for why I think and worry that the sister and mom secretly talk about us and how we\u2019re arguing again and how they want to talk to my bf about us and ask him why he\u2019s with me and that they think I\u2019m a terrible person who should break up with him and move out. His sister once asked him to get drinks alone and I couldn\u2019t stop freaking out that she just wanted to talk about our relationship and wanted to tell him that she doesn\u2019t like me and that she would encourage him to break up with him. \n\nI understand it\u2019s normal for family to worry and that it\u2019s reasonable for them to want my bf to be happy. I have a very difficult time recovering after our arguments because of this and it usually results in me staying in our room and office space and avoiding going up to make food so I go a very long time without eating because I avoid them. When my bf and I do reconcile before seeing them, I always feel the need to show more affection to my bf so they can see that everything is good between us. Or when he\u2019s at work and I\u2019m home with them, I talk about him more so they hear that I\u2019m comfortable talking about him and we\u2019ve made up. If they don\u2019t see us together after arguing, I always assume they\u2019re mad at me. There have also been times where they\u2019re quiet and awkward around me after arguments so this makes me uncomfortable too and makes me feel judged. \n\nI never thought to think this could also be OCD and my mind lying to me. It feels so impossible in the moment for me to get out of this loop to go and feed myself. It\u2019s so bad. It becomes very difficult to take care of myself because I fear being judged. "

I had the same thing for 5 years but with sexism towards women and it was when i had sexual orientation ocd where i was scared I'm gay.

And idk if it's my mind or the algorithm but i feel like i keep seeing this shit, i was doing slightly better a few days ago and then i see a tiktok live of a black person and he kept bringing on some teens i think they sounded like 15 or something, and they all kept saying n..er monkey all that like it's funny, i saw that for 20 mins this all that was happening, every single person kept spamming that. Anyway not sure how to deal with this, i either see it as ocd and don't avoid anything to get desensitized, or i avoid all comment sections forever which would be avoidance if my issue is ocd.

Although after that rough couple of weeks it went away because I knew I loved them and wouldn\u2019t ever hurt somebody because I had such a big heart. \n\nBut for the next couple years until now I would watch or see something that  would restart the cycle over and it would take about a month to get it to go away. This normally happened always after the time change because then there\u2019s less day light and I don\u2019t function to well without it. Keep in mind after each of these cycles I would feel so relieved and free and would have happy summers and springs. \n\nBut this year feels different. It all started after watching a world war z movie and it started again. And it was normal at least I know what I would have to go through. But this time it feels like I\u2019ve lost all love for people I used to love. Like I think if they died would I even care. But with this loss of love the thoughts are intensifying and it also feels like I have less anxiety for them. I\u2019ve been going to a therapist for a couple weeks and got put on anxiety and depression meds and it has only helped the pit that was in my stomach. Oh and also with this cycle when I get angry or frustrated the thoughts are there with it and it\u2019s never been like that and I hate this.

Today, I spent around 4 hours writing down trains of thoughts about literally everything that comes to mind into my designated Discord server, wrote on sheets of paper, created notes on my phone. When misspelling something or making a mistake, I also need to document it.\nI know I will never look at that stuff again, yet I still spend at least a good third of my awake time on it. The other two thirds are accompanied by me pondering about said thoughts and giving it my all not to forget.\nEven when I am about to go to sleep, I will think about what's being said in the podcasts I am currently falling asleep to (horrible habit, I know) and get up in order to fill in the information I apparently so desperately need in the future.

    "content": "Since August of 2024, I've been having OCD fear of hell that will not go away.\n\nFor context, I'm not religious. Early last year, I was really into watching psychic mediums do live readings for people on TikTok and I was completely convinced that they were communicating with spirits of people who had passed and I found so much comfort in it when they said that the spirits said there's no hell.\n\nThat was all ruined after I stumbled upon a video of a Christian woman who used to be a medium. She said she found out the truth, and that mediums aren't communicating with loved ones, but they are communicating with familiar spirits/demons and what they do is impersonate your loved ones to make you believe that we all go to heaven without needing religion.\n\nThat made me feel sick and decieved. My comfort and peace of mind were out the window. It made me cry. It made me feel like everything that ever brought me comfort when it came to positive NDE stories and reincarnation stories were all just tricks from the devil and that there really IS a hell and that he's just trying to get us all to go there.\n\nHell is all I can think about, 24/7 and I feel like I can't even enjoy life anymore, because it's just a ticking clock until I die and get tortured for eternity and it terrifies me. And I find it really difficult to deny that Hell exists when I hear about stories of people on their death bed, screaming about hell and seeing demons. Most people will say it's just DMT, but I don't think that's the case.\n\nI will admit, I've done some shitty things in my life, but I'm trying to be better, in hopes to make up for it. I do truly feel remorseful for some of the things. Some things I don't feel remorse for, but I truly want to. I want to feel remorse, because I feel that I'm an inherently bad person if I don't. I don't want to be a bad person, I want to genuinely be better. I honestly envy super sweet people, but I feel like a fraud because of my past and I feel like I'll go to hell for it anyway."

After the storm passed, even though I didn't feel comfortable sharing with him, I forced myself to open about it and he said that's ok everyone has mental problems to an extent and it is about how you handle it and like months later when I was sharing about how ocd affects me, I said I'll be miserable to which he said that doesnt give you the pass to treat someone like shit and later he realized it and apologized to me and said I have to understand him bc the prev girl he was with would weaponize her mental health against him and that was a nightmare for him and he left her for that.The main issue is our lack of emotional connection. He\u2019s surface-level emotionally and avoids deep conversations, often changing the subject or not checking in on my mental health (though he does for physical health). I feel he\u2019s not curious about me\u2014my thoughts, views, or memories\u2014and doesn\u2019t give me the emotional space to be myself, while he\u2019s fully himself with me.

My boss thinks differently and basically told me to do better.\n\nI started to spiral to the point of being physically sick.\n\nI see my doctor. He suggests upping my meds back to maximum. But if I do that, it will slow me down even more.\n\nSo doctor is suggesting I may need to go back on disability. Which I don't want to do because I worked so hard to get off disability.\n\nAnd now I'm at home, should be sleeping but I'm stuck in a rumination spiral and it sucks.\n\nAnyway, that's my little rant. Thank you for taking the time to read. I hope everyone has an amazing day."

She was devastated at the way her marriage was going, her health, and her career being greatly derailed by the shutdown.\n\nI partially blame myself. I was so inundated by the grief of the shutdown, my career being paused, and obviously my own health shit (yes, mostly this disorder) that I don't think I did enough for her.\n\nI never sent her a card.\n\nI never sent her flowers.\n\nI never sent her a care package.\n\nI never gave her my cell for emergencies.\n\nI never told her to contact me if she was desperate. \n\nI didn't reach out enough.\n\nWhen she seemed better, I believed it.\n\nSurvivor's guilt is real. I wish I had been less self-absorbed and done more. And maybe if I wasn't so preoccupied with this basic rabies of the brain, I would have realized that she wasn't doing well.\n\nWe were middle school buddies who reconnected after both losing our beloved broadcast jobs. She was my virtual penal. For just under a year, we would talk, joke, commiserate, listen, and prop each other up.\n\nI really miss my friend.\n\nIt's hard enough to stay alive and not go apeshit with this garbage, absolute POS condition. Let alone be there for someone else! \n\nIf there's a heaven, and I hope there is, I hope she's there...and that she doesn't hate me. \ud83d\udc94 "

    "content": "TW: Suicidal Thoughts \n\nHey everyone,\nSince I was young, I've always been bothered by my deep intrusive sexual thoughts. As I've gotten older, they're still there, but have extended to places that make me feel like a terrible person. It's almost like my mind is forcing me to think of the worst things I can. Over the past few days specifically, the meaning behind those thoughts have clawed at my mind, and I'm reminded of shame and disgust in my head that tears at my perception of myself and my life. \n\nI've never hated myself more, and am starting to wonder if I should be here at all.\n\n I want help, and I've had therapy for a different kind of OCD before, but I am financially reliant on my parents, and only have access to treatment through them. I would consider my relationship with my parents to be loving, however, the thought that they won't love me anymore, or view me as a bad person scares me from talking to them. I am trying to build up the courage to tell them, but I don't know how or what to say. What should I say to get help?\n\nHow can I combat this self loating?"

Stuff like \u201cI will not slam doors\u201d or \u201cI will not hit my brother\u201d 100 times. Just curious if anyone else was made to do this as a kid (also if you do it now with ocd)?"

I just keep deluding myself into thinking I'm a horrible person who actually physically assaulted someone. I go through pretty bad false memory ocd a lot. I was wondering if anyone else who has this problem of false memory ocd can share what they go through so I don't feel alone or maybe even any advice as to how to deal with this particular situation specifically from people who overcame false memory ocd in their own experiences?"

I\u2019ve been driving myself mad downloading my message history in hopes I find the messages and i never find it.

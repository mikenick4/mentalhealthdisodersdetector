The first domino of reverting the past decade of progress for LGBTQ+ rights has been pushed and it really looks like, both because I have to or for my safety, that I'm going to have to detransition. I thought that I had a pretty healthy relationship with my gender as in I don't hate my masculinity, however the thought of detransitioning is eating away at me. I don't mean to scare anyone, but I am struggling to handle the idea of living without transitioning. I am currently already suffering from anxiety due to moving into adulthood and this has made it so that I've spent every night hyperventilating for hours until I knock myself out. I don't know what to do or what to think and this anxiety has kept me from even doing the things I like. I want to crawl in a hole and just stop existing because I hate the idea of living in a country that hates me. I'm scared. I'm tired. And I'm just so sad. Im sorry."

I\u2019ve had to bring my cats in with me up until today when I just randomly decided to do it alone and there was no problem. I do get anxious thoughts, but instead of making be anxious, I get depressed, with also some suicidal thoughts. In my experience, I\u2019ll take suicidal thoughts and depression any day, over the anxiety. I am finally feeling calm. And I feel safe enough to actually let myself be calm, instead of checking for anxiety and thinking that it\u2019s no use relaxing cause the anxiety will be back any second. I\u2019ve been struggling with going to concerts because I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll get anxiety before it starts and I\u2019ll have to leave. Tomorrow I\u2019m going to a concert and I have absolutely no fear of it happening.

    "content": "I wrote a piece on how I recovered from anxiety disorders on Medium. But, I don't know if this subreddit allows links to go through so I'll just share the whole story here. I feel like that's the last step of my recovery: self expression and sharing with others. I know that reddit subthreads can be discouraging and people don't speak of recovery and being on the other side of it, cause they're too busy living their lives. I've been reflecting on my experience so far and felt inspired to share with community that may need a message like that. So I'm sharing it here, here is the story in full:\n\n# My Experience Overcoming Disordered Anxiety\n\nI know if I were you, I wouldn\u2019t want a 10-page long ramble session about someone\u2019s life story. I\u2019m assuming you clicked on this because either you or someone you know is experiencing disordered anxiety. I only hope to provide some insight through sharing my experience and I will be linking the sources that quite literally changed my life down below. With that being said, I want to make this as impactful and direct as possible so that it will hopefully leave you with some insights of your own. Here it is.\n\n# Briefly About Me\n\nMy experience with disordered anxiety was intense. I\u2019ve struggled with anxiety since I was 9, but for the last 2 years, I couldn\u2019t leave the house. I couldn\u2019t get in a car, use public transportation, go to grocery stores, do anything really, you name it. It got to the point that I would have a panic attack walking 5 minutes up my neighbourhood and I would have to turn around. Now, that\u2019s crazy, right? Not as crazy as actually thinking you were going crazy and feeling unreal, which is also a very common symptom of severely disordered anxiety. So, what were my labels: Agoraphobia, Panic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Derealization and Depersonalization.\n\nThat was me at 22 years old. But, about a week ago, I celebrated my 24th birthday with people I love in crowded restaurants, movie theatres, and bars. I\u2019ve been going on long drives, and planning trips. Weirdly enough, it\u00a0*feels*\u00a0like those last 2 years never happened. Though, I reflect on those years quite a lot to this day, which is what inspired me to write this.\n\n# So, What Happened?\n\nThe experience of being homebound freaked me out so much that I looked into every method, tip, and solution under the sun. From CBT to CBD. From SE to IFS. From A to Z. I did them. Some of them did help to a certain extent, and they had the right idea because they attempted to steer me away from my thoughts and bring my attention to the sensations in the body, but it wasn\u2019t enough. I would go right back to what I was doing: overthinking. I would spend hours in my bedroom feeling like I was close to a solution, without having made any progress in reality. The reality was, I was just in my room\u2026 thinking. I thought I was on the right track to finding an answer to conquer anxiety and finally leaving my house again.\u00a0**Little did I know, that anxiety was not a problem to be solved, and not a problem at all.**\n\nWhat do I mean by that? Now, before I go into what\u00a0*was*\u00a0effective for me, I want to set a bit of a realistic expectation.\u00a0**Recovering from anxiety is not a one-size-fits-all situation.**\u00a0Everyone is different, so take what you need and leave the rest. Medication was not part of my journey but it can be a wonderful tool for many. We can all reach the same destination by taking different paths. We are all unique and so our paths will be too, but recovery is possible for everyone. I am simply sharing my personal experience.\n\n**I outline anxiety in a really simplistic manner and that is done intentionally.**\u00a0Simplicity was key, in my experience because overcomplicating anxiety made me resist the discomfort and prolonged my suffering for years. As I was recovering, I had many moments of pain and discomfort, and it was a gradual process where I had to experience something several times until I believed everything I was taught.\u00a0**We all want a quick solution but we usually learn through repetition, and experiencing the challenge firsthand.**\u00a0You\u2019ll face the same lessons repeatedly and that\u2019s perfectly normal. That is the point! Every small step back towards your life, despite how it feels, is a step towards coming back to yourself.\u00a0So, what does that look like?\n\n# What I Learned\n\n**Let me start this off by saying, our body is always working in our favour, even during a panic attack.**\u00a0This sentiment alone sparked monumental shifts in my recovery. I hated panic attacks, they were the bane of my existence. My intense fear of panic is what kept me homebound. I even forced myself to face my fears and be willing to feel panic just so I would\u00a0*not*\u00a0feel panic \u2014 didn\u2019t work, of course. Force doesn\u2019t make sense here because that adds more pressure which disrupts our nervous system even more. I truly started making strides in recovery once I stopped fearing panic attacks. This is what I learned about them:\n\n* **Panic attacks are adrenaline rushes.**\u00a0Adrenaline pumps through our body to keep us\u00a0***alive,***\u00a0not to kill us. In times of danger, it is our superpower by numbing our pain and giving us super strength, and energy for the situation. When the adrenaline is needed and used, a panic attack wouldn\u2019t occur.\u00a0**Adrenaline has a function, it is working in our favour.**\n* Leading to my next point,\u00a0***the only cause of a panic attack is a whole lot of overthinking.***\u00a0Think about it (no pun intended), if adrenaline is put to use in the right circumstances, there is no space to think, we just act. The blood rushes to the big muscle groups in the right circumstances, we don\u2019t have to plan, we don\u2019t fear the adrenaline itself. We don\u2019t have a panic attack.\n* So, this means, it isn\u2019t the grocery store causing your panic attack, nor is it any external situation. It is always your thinking about the experience, or your\u00a0*overthinking*\u00a0about it.\n* Our system is designed for the \u201cnow\u201d, it is not sophisticated enough to realize the brain is imagining a scary scenario. Therefore, panic attacks can work as an alarm that we are unintentionally misusing our system and our imagination. It works as a wake-up call to come back to reality.\n* Our bodies are constantly healing and regenerating. So, all we need to do is trust in our natural healing system to bring us back to balance, more on that later.\n* Our brain is a pattern recognition machine that uses information from the past to predict the future. It\u2019s simply doing its job.\u00a0**It can\u2019t comprehend what it hasn\u2019t experienced yet.**\u00a0It doesn\u2019t even make sense a lot of the time, it is so impersonal and random.\u00a0**There is nothing new to learn from a repetitive machine, we can take it less seriously.**\n* When there is nothing to immediately act on, it can feel uncomfortable. The energy seeks release, but we often misinterpret it as dangerous, leading to a panic attack. Panic attacks are simply a fear of fear itself.\u00a0**The discomfort is a good indicator that you are safe.**\n* We can overthink and stress ourselves out about symptoms so much that we can dissociate, disconnect from our surroundings, and feel unreal.\u00a0**This is also a signal that our brain is tired and in need of rest.**\n* **My favourite point: an adrenaline rush has a shelf-life of 8 minutes, and a half-life of 4 minutes.**\n\n# Here\u2019s Why This Was Relevant for Me\n\n***You think you want liberation from this anxious energy when the truth is, it wants liberation from you. This is why it keeps coming up; it wants to be free of you, just as much as you want to be free of it. \u2014 Paul David***\n\nHere is the thing, if you went to the doctor\u2019s office, and they told you they were going to inject you with adrenaline but it would leave the system completely within 8 minutes, and start to fade within the first 4 minutes, how different would your experience be? Chances are, you\u2019d feel the symptoms of the adrenaline but with a sense of security, then it would pass in 8 minutes. Would that turn into a panic disorder? It wouldn\u2019t. The energy wants to move through you, it wants to be liberated from you too.\n\nThis is the case for every anxiety symptom \u2014\u00a0**every painful symptom you currently have will gradually dissipate once you learn to trust that the body is always working in your favour, whether you realize it or not.**\u00a0It may take some time, and there may be days that are more painful than others, but that is a natural part of the process, it is expected. We are built to tolerate discomfort, have you ever been sore from a workout, or broken a bone? How different was your experience when you didn\u2019t have to worry about it?\n\nUnderstanding all of this brought a sense of ease and confidence in my experience. Now, it wasn\u2019t a battle against anxiety, why would it be? Panic attacks and all anxious symptoms became neutral and impersonal alarms that I interpreted as a sign of my overthinking. It wasn\u2019t the car, the place, the person \u2014 I just had distorted thinking running through my head. I slowly started to believe that my symptoms weren\u2019t against me and that made a world of a difference in tolerating the discomfort. I understood that being in real-time danger would leave no space to overthink,\u00a0**because thinking does not keep me safe**.\u00a0That was mind-blowing for an over-thinker like me.\n\n# On a Deeper Note\n\nI was taught how our bodies always return to balance, how it is\u00a0*designed*\u00a0to return to balance. When we break a bone, we don\u2019t have to overthink it into healing, nor do we have to do that with the flu, or soreness from a workout.\u00a0**We can tolerate those feelings and still be involved with our life and what matters to us.**\u00a0They don\u2019t become front-page news. We also don\u2019t overthink to get our heart to beat, or grow babies. It happens on its own. There is less for us to do.\n\nAs I believed what I learned more, I started to be filled with wonder at how beautifully we are designed, in ways beyond our control. We are nature and nature is intelligent: forest fires work as beneficial component for a healthy ecosystem, planets can spin and orbit the sun, flowers know when to bloom and how to face the sun. T**here is no thinking involved**. This sparked more ease within me. I trusted my body so much more to do what it was already doing, that made all of the difference. So anxiety was never anything to solve, it became a helpful alarm that I was using my head too much. I slowly started seeing how much life I had missed out on because I was so involved with my thoughts, and that kept me stuck, to a very serious extent.\u00a0**And**\u00a0i**f you feel stuck you need to do something different in order to yield different results. We can\u2019t achieve this through overthinking**.\u00a0I do believe it is that simple.\n\nThese experiences are not personal to most people, but for some reason, people with disordered anxiety take anxiety very personally. None of us are doing this on purpose, it is a misunderstanding of the system. But, taking it personally is what kept me stuck. I took it so seriously, and I thought it was a real problem. I wouldn\u2019t beat myself up for wanting rest and fluids if I had the flu, for example. Once my attitude around it changed, things started to change.\n\n**I reflected on how, when my car is freezing cold and I turn the heat on, I don\u2019t suffer in the cold because I know the car will warm up soon.**\u00a0I like to think of panic attacks and recovering from disordered anxiety in the same light. Once our attitude towards it has a sense of ease and openness, the experience shifts. As I moved forward, each uncomfortable experience became an opportunity to see the truths I had learned play out in real-time.\n\n# What Changed Afterwards?\n\nThis had already sparked me to stretch out my comfort zone in the smallest ways. This time it wasn\u2019t through force but through curiosity and a true willingness to get back to my life. I started doing the things that were important to me again, which was going on a walk, for example. I would feel that adrenaline rush and I would see it as my superpower strength fired off in the wrong scenario. The experience was not\u00a0*that*\u00a0scary anymore.\u00a0**So, I slowly abandoned myself to how I felt and went back to my life.**\u00a0I treated lingering symptoms the same way I would treat sore muscles.\u00a0There was a lot of repetition here, and I thought \u201cOh, maybe I can do this. Oh, and then this? And then maybe this!\u201d but it happened through a\u00a0*wanting*\u00a0to do it vs. forcing myself to do it to overcome pain. It was in the spirit that I was doing it in.\n\nI started with walks which turned to going to stores, then restaurants, and eventually taking shuttle buses which took me 9 hours away from home.\u00a0**This sounds linear but I have to emphasize that it wasn\u2019t.**\u00a0Each step forward \u2014 however daunting \u2014 became a milestone in my journey. Even when it felt like I was going backwards, which\u00a0*we never can by the way*. So, what might that look like for you? Remember, nothing is too small.\n\nWorrying and overthinking became irrelevant after learning that. I do believe it is that simple. I\u2019m still human and I worry from time to time, but my relationship with this entire experience is drastically different. More importantly, I don\u2019t fear my experience and it doesn\u2019t dictate what I do. I like to see moments of worry and discomfort as opportunities to see my imagination at play and come back to reality. Looking back, from a calm and clear mind, I can really see the gift in it and my intention was to highlight that (even just a little bit) here. I hope this helped, friends!\n\n# Resources\n\nTo end it off, here are three resources that were the most impactful throughout my journey:\n\nLily Sais (@peacefromwithin) \u2014 alongside her free content \u2014 I highly recommend joining her community as well.

    "content": "Hey everyone, first time posting here. I\u2019ve suffered from severe anxiety (general, social, and agoraphobia) for 16 years. My anxiety goes through its phases: sometimes it\u2019s manageable (but still there) other times it\u2019s debilitating where I can\u2019t even leave the house.\n\nRecently had some severe, different anxiety that was brought on by talks/thoughts of marriage and having kids with my girlfriend of 3 years. It\u2019s like my every day anxiety brought on by doing regular tasks has disappeared because my mind is preoccupied by another HUGE life milestone. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve calmed down a bit from the prospect of those thoughts, I don\u2019t really have any anxiety (for now) for the past few days, other than the occasional racing thought. While it\u2019s a huge welcome and blessing, considering I was so held down by anxiety for so long and was in a dark place not that long ago, it feels\u2026odd.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to explain it but it\u2019s almost like my mind is craving those anxious thoughts to feel \u201cnormal\u201d again. I should be ecstatic to not be feeling anxious but I just feel weird and not normal without that anxiety.\n\nCan anyone else relate to this and provide tips on moving forward?\n\nThank you!"

The first one was in my car and I recovered quickly and felt better the rest of the day. The second one I felt exhausted from, so I just went to bed. I proceeded to have the worst disrupted sleep ever including a nightmare.\n\nThe next day, I felt dizzy, lightheaded, and fatigued all day. I assumed I would just be fine in the next day but that was 5 days ago. \n\nI did recover from the fatigue and dizziness, but ever since then, I've still had this general feeling of unease and discomfort that won't leave even when distracting myself. It's not my typical anxiety, where I would worry about something specific like school, but still be fine and able to relax with a movie or special interest. I am just constantly uneased and feeling a bit apathetic. I can't relax or feel excitement. I've even lost my appetite and sex drive which is really concerning me. I'll have mood swings, where one second I think I'm feeling fine but then the next second the feeling is back. I think it's generally being triggered by thinking about the anxiety. Thinking about the anxiety that I had just makes me more anxious.\n\nI have a doctor's appointment in a couple days to discuss this. I feel like I should also get some blood work and a long-awaited referral to a therapist. In the meantime, I was wondering if anyone has ever experienced something like this and recovered? It's such a hard feeling to explain that I feel bad for rambling on about. I just hope I will be feeling better in a week."

    "title": "Waking up anxious on the days I go to work even though I like my job",
    "content": "\nI guess this is sort of a rant but I\u2019m also curious if anyone has had or is having an experience similar to me because it just feels so weird.\n\nI (24F) have been dealing with anxiety (GAD) since middle school. My anxiety always has been triggered by big changes, so transitioning from middle to high school was a huge challenge and then high school to college was also rough, but I made it through. Each time, I just needed some time to get used to the new situation and eventually I was fine. After the initial transition period, I could go months or even years without feeling a single ounce of anxiety. I\u2019ve grown a lot and learned a lot about my anxiety since I was younger, some things have changed, but that was something that always stayed constant: after the transition period, after I got comfortable where I was, whether at a new school or new job, the anxiety eventually subsided. \n\nNot this time. This time it\u2019s weird (compared to what I\u2019ve experienced in the past with my anxiety) and I\u2019m so frustrated and confused. Basically, I started a new job at the end of August last year. I had a little bit of anxiety during the transition (to be expected). But it was actually a lot better than it had been in the past. September comes and goes and I\u2019m doing pretty well, getting used to the new job. Then October hits and things change. I\u2019m not sure if it was my medication or what (I was seeing a psychiatrist that was not great who I have since stopped seeing, I think maybe she changed something but I honestly don\u2019t even remember). During transition periods/periods of high anxiety, my anxiety is often worse in the mornings. This isn\u2019t new. What was new that mainly started in October was that I started throwing up in the mornings (never happened before) and waking up shaking with my heart racing. The shaking and heard racing would happen during periods of high anxiety in the past, but never did I just wake up like that. What is so weird to me is it\u2019s not like I woke up and started overthinking and getting in my head and THEN got anxious. I literally wake up anxious. It\u2019s like I wake up and my body is in fight or flight mode. Shaking, heart racing, throwing up. FOR NO REASON!!! That\u2019s the thing! I literally love my new job, I finally feel like I\u2019m in a great place, I\u2019m getting married this year, we\u2019re moving in together soon\u2026and yes I know what you\u2019re thinking, that\u2019s a lot of big life changes, that could be causing some of the anxiety. And yes, maybe a little bit. But that\u2019s normal big life changes anxiety. Not waking up in the morning throwing up anxiety. Is it? Either way, here\u2019s where it gets weirder\u2026this only happens on days that I go to work. Weekends I\u2019m completely fine. Sometimes Sunday nights I get a little uneasy because I anticipate that morning anxiety, but like Monday we had off and I was totally fine. Reminder: I really like my job!!! Plus, the majority of the day I\u2019m fine! It\u2019s literally only from the moment I wake up to when I walk in the building at work. Then it goes away and I enjoy my day. WTF???\n\nGod I\u2019m SO frustrated. Throughout all of this and throughout my life, I have seen many therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, etc. I am seeing a therapist now who I\u2019ve been with for a while, she\u2019s amazing and she has been giving me a lot of good strategies to help me get through the mornings. I am also seeing a new psychiatrist and am currently working on a list of all of the medications I\u2019ve taken in the past and trying to remember what helped and what didn\u2019t to help give her some more information. Some of the meds I\u2019ve tried in the past are bupropion (wellbutrin), gabapentin (neurontin), aripiprazole (abilify), lamotrigine (lamictal), desvenlafaxine (pristiq), clonazepam (klonipin), sertraline (zoloft), propranolol (inderal), busprione (burpar)\u2026to name a few lol (that\u2019s literally all of them). I\u2019m currently on duloxetine (cymbalta) and have been on it for years, but the new doc suggested I try to come off of it and try escitalopram (lexapro) instead. I think I was on lexapro many many years ago but I honestly don\u2019t remember so we\u2019re going to give it a shot. Most recently, I also tried prazosin (minipress) but it had no effect. \n\nThank you if you read all this. Again, I\u2019m mainly ranting bc I\u2019m so frustrated and I feel like my brain/body is making miserable for no reason, but I am curious if anyone has experienced anything like this before, if you got past it and how.\n"

    "content": "First time posting here but I need to talk about this\n\nI\u2019m taking APUSH and am one of four students who were allowed to take it two years early. Previously I have had no experience with test anxiety, I could go in and get an A every time in every class. It has been my goal to be Valedictorian, something that I\u2019m pretty sure is a goal I share with like two other people which was my main motivation in taking the class early to pace myself on getting all my AP\u2019s done. First term of APUSH I did great and got an A+, 100% on the dbq final. However, I noticed myself having a lot more anxiety before, during, and after tests. This term is a whole other story as some of the people in my class are like on another level of gifted. I\u2019ve always been smart but had to work at it more than a lot of my peers in advanced classes. Every discussion I\u2019ve been filled with anxiety and beat myself up over answering questions. I don\u2019t get along with my teacher great who seems completely puzzled by the amount of questions I ask and when I ask for help. Now today came for my first unit test, a combination of periods 4 and 5. I studied hours, did practice mcq\u2019s and saq\u2019s, did great on the progress checks in AP classroom. I walk into class feeling like I could pass out but sit down and start the test. I get through the mcq part easily and start to type my saq, it was so frickin easy too but I started to hear everyone type and could imagine them going from question to question with no problem and I genuinely had to focus on not vomiting on the table and debating if I needed to literally run to the bathroom and throw up. I have no idea what came over me but I was holding back tears and all of a sudden I couldn\u2019t spell or write sentences. Before I knew it I got parts A and B of 1/2 saq\u2019s done and class was almost over. Holy crap I left a whole saq blank. I asked my teacher if I could come in and finish it up and I was sure he\u2019d say yes as he has ALWAYS let people do that and he said no. I just started silently sobbing. I tried to get something on the page but I was shaking so hard and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how I looked so dumb. This was supposed to be my best performance on a test, I always do so good on the writing portions and I just bombed it. \n\nI feel like my life is kind of over. I prepared myself more than ever before and did so much practice over the weekend and the morning of watched the heimler history videos. I\u2019m sorry if this comes off as ramble-y or if I just sound like I\u2019m whining but this is the first time I\u2019ve really messed up THIS bad. "

I just want to be seen as smart or someone to well, have as their role model. But i just end up being the smart kid who will probably fail because he doesn't study enough. My friendships are also starting to slightly fade away. My friends got a lot of studying to do and I get it. I don't want to pressure them. But I have been feeling lonely and I just want someone to be by my side through this tough time. I have also been going through a lot due to my romantic relationships. Such as breakups, pressure in general again, and overall anxiety. I also recently lost my grandfather and despite not being that close to him it hurt, it hurt because he was the first person I ever lost and it just had to happen in this hellhole of a year. I just feel as if my body and mind is crumbling apart and i cant take anymore anxiety but it just keeps on coming. This whole post is just a whole lot of messy writing and most of it might not even make sense but I just had to. I had to share it somewhere because I cant keep it by myself anymore.."

I thought it would at least be a little fun, or maybe even fulfilling, but it\u2019s turned out to be the exact opposite.\n\nThe environment I\u2019m in is anything but professional. My coworkers and management are, for lack of a better term, lazy and unmotivated. There\u2019s so much toxicity here, and it feels like people are just out for themselves. If there\u2019s ever a problem or disagreement, no one tries to sit down and discuss it like adults. Instead, they snap at you like they\u2019re in some sort of gang.\n\nThis is such a stark contrast to the professional settings I\u2019ve worked in before, where issues came up (because they always do) but were addressed calmly and constructively. Here, it\u2019s like everyone\u2019s walking on eggshells, and the second something doesn\u2019t go someone\u2019s way, it\u2019s chaos.\n\nOn top of all that, I\u2019m a foreigner working in a new country, and honestly, everything feels overwhelming. It\u2019s already hard enough trying to adapt to a new culture and work environment, but being stuck in this toxic job just makes it so much worse. I feel completely out of place.\n\nWhat makes it even harder is that I\u2019m scared to open up to my husband and his family about how I\u2019m feeling. This is my first job in this country, and they\u2019re all so career-oriented and successful. I feel like they\u2019ll judge me if I tell them how much I\u2019m struggling. I don\u2019t want to come off as a crybaby or as someone who can\u2019t handle things. But the truth is, I feel like I\u2019m barely holding it together. I\u2019ve been trying so hard to keep my head above water, but it\u2019s exhausting. I\u2019ve been applying to other jobs for months now, but so far, nothing has come through. I feel completely stuck, and it\u2019s taking a toll on me in ways I didn\u2019t expect.\n\nOn top of everything, I\u2019ve already been diagnosed with depression, and this job is only making things worse. I\u2019m not just mentally drained\u2014I\u2019m physically exhausted as well. It feels like this job is sucking the life out of me, and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep this up. Iguess I\u2019m just here to vent and maybe find some solidarity. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you get through it? I don\u2019t want to give up entirely, but I\u2019m starting to feel like that might be my only option.\n\nAny advice or encouragement would mean the world to me right now."

Groceries, reporting to probation, and occasionally going out after being begged enough by my girlfriend. \n\nI do my groceries at the earliest hour they open, wash my clothes at a 24hr laundry and go past midnight.

I feel that I'm surrounded by morons who like to test people's patience and I'm afraid of being incarcerated over someone I just couldn't walk away from. But I also don't want to live in constant restraint. \n\nI have a strong desire to leave the city and retire off into a home with land and no neighbors around me, but I'm stuck where I am because of probation and I also need the money for that. I'd like to either find employment as a starting line cook, to eventually move up as I have a passion for cooking and I want a job that challenges me, but I also don't have to deal with customers. Otherwise, a remote job is what I'm looking for. \n\nI know if I find a purpose, a goal to look forward to, and skills to improve upon that these anxious thoughts will go away.

    "content": "I've been struggling with anxiety for as long as i can remember. i've had it so long to a point where i can't even fathom what a life without constant anxiety would even look like. throughout different points in my life, my anxiety has manifested in different ways. when i was a kid, i would just get super scared for no good reason and go cry to mom. in my adolescent years, id say up until age 17-18, it was mostly a feeling of impending doom. like everything was out of my control. just constantly overwhelmed even if i didn't have all that much going on. but for the last two years, every anxiety attack turns into me spiraling about my health. at first, it wasn't terrible and didn't happen too often. maybe like once or twice every two weeks. but these last six months, i kid you not, it's been happening AT LEAST 5 days a week. and let me tell you, im so fucking tired of it. \n\ntwo years ago, one of my closest friends that i've had since i was 11 years old got diagnosed with osteosarcoma cancer. for some context, her mother passed away of breast cancer over 10 years ago. before she passed, they learnt she had this gene called the TP53 mutation. if you're unfamiliar with what that is, it's basically a super rare gene that almost always inevitably leads to cancer. they didn't have these kinds of gene tests back in the day, so my friends mom had no way of knowing (until it was too late) that she'd be passing down that horror of a gene by having biological children. my friend beat the cancer in april of 2024 after one hell of a battle including countless surgeries that led her to be in a wheelchair. she was on the road to recovery, learning how to walk again and trying to resume back to her normal life until the cancer returned for a second time in november. same cancer, but way more aggressive. it's too dangerous to operate this time around, so she's been on the chemo pill. they're hoping it shrinks within the next few months so that it at least becomes safe to operate. and don't even get me started on her older sister who's also dealing with the same cancer for the second time as well after she also beat it the first time. it's nothing short of a nightmare of a situation for this family. \n\nanyways, when my friend got diagnosed the first time, i couldn't understand it. although the gene mutation was explanation enough, i still couldn't wrap my head around the fact that this girl who's been nothing but a kind, radiant soul her entire life somehow wound up living a life like this. a life where she's constantly fighting a battle against her own body. i thought, if it could happen to people like her and her sister who are two of the most genuine people i've ever met, why wouldn't it happen to me? even though i constantly remind myself that i don't have that gene or a history of cancer in my family and try to force my brain to understand the fact that the cards they were dealt were just extremely unlucky, i still can't help but spiral with every pain or weird feeling in my body ever since my friend was diagnosed the first time. \n\nfor the past two years, while in the midsts of my panic attacks, i not only feel severely anxious, but also stupidly selfish. i always think, here i am in a healthy body with the luxury of living a normal life and yet i have the nerve to constantly stress over stuff like this, meanwhile my friend who i love so much is the one actually dealing with the shit i'm constantly afraid of. sometimes she'll ask me what's wrong, but i've never been able to tell her the truth. how can i? it would be so silly to say it to her of all people. i don't even know how id feel if i were in her shoes and someone without any health problems told me that shit. i just feel like such a terrible person constantly thinking of the worst when in reality, im perfectly fine and have the luxury of living a normal life when my friend doesn't. my brain just refuses to shut the fuck up. \n\nall that being said, i just want this to stop. i'm sick of constantly thinking im dying every night. im sick of spending my prime years spiraling over little pains that my brain practically gaslights my body into feeling. im sick of feeling this way when my fears are my friend's reality. it's exhausting and selfish of me. \n\nsorry for the long read, i just felt like some context was important to somewhat understand why i constantly feel this way. i'm desperate for a solution. if you have advice, an idea, or literally anything that could even be just potentially helpful, please let me know\n\n"

My chest was so tight and a ball of fury was swirling around down there, I didn't even want to speak to say what I wanted. I've almost never felt like this! It's truly concerning...\n\nCan anyone else relate or have similar experiences? Did it get better for you? Should I stop right away?"

I can go out but school is really really hard, and I always have bad anxiety before going outside.\n\nI've been struggling really bad with anticipatory anxiety, and many times that is what causes panic attacks. Before meetings with teachers or my therapist, I always feel like I'm gonna faint and I walk in circles from the moment I wake up until the meeting/event (even though I always do them online). Sometimes for days I feel like this, except for the few moments when I forget. The problem is that now I feel this way before doing the smallest things. I will use gaming as an example, because I game a lot. When I'm in the moment where I have to focus or do something that is 1v1 I get the same bad anxiety, and that's for such a small thing. Sometimes I get that feeling just by going to the kitchen if one of my family members are there. I guess I've always had anticipatory anxiety when I think about it, and that's the reason I've been having panic attacks before I realised that they were panic attacks (I only realised when they got so bad I ended up laying on a random buss stop crying and trying to breath, almost fainting). But I've always been a really open and social/curious person so I don't really know how that makes sense. Because of that I also feel like I've lost a part of myself. I just really want to be able to do the things I love, but I can't. How do I stop this? I'm nervous about absolutely EVERYTHING and I never try to avoid things because I know that will make it worse, but it still doesn't get better."

You know the type\u2014the ones who say, \u201cJust go for a walk,\u201d \u201cJust breathe,\u201d or the classic: \u201cPull yourself up by your bootstraps.\u201d\n\nIf it were that simple, don\u2019t you think I would\u2019ve done it already? If I could magically cure my anxiety, depression, or trauma with a brisk jog or some yoga, I wouldn\u2019t need therapy, medication, or years of unlearning the damage caused by abuse.\n\nTrauma doesn\u2019t just go away. It fundamentally changes you. I\u2019m realizing more and more how deep the physiological impact of trauma really is. Complex PTSD isn\u2019t just about \u201cbad memories\u201d or \u201cfeeling sad.\u201d It rewires your nervous system, changes how your brain processes stress, affects your body on a hormonal level, and impacts everything from sleep to digestion to emotional regulation. This isn\u2019t just a mindset problem\u2014it\u2019s a full-body experience, and the idea that I should just think my way out of it is beyond insulting.\n\nAnd what\u2019s worse? The condescension. The implication that I\u2019m somehow choosing this, that I\u2019m weak, lazy, or just \u201cdwelling\u201d on things. No, I\u2019m not \u201cstuck in the past.\u201d The past is stuck in me. When you\u2019ve lived through years of abuse, your brain doesn\u2019t just snap back like a rubber band the moment you decide to \u201cmove on.\u201d Healing isn\u2019t linear. It\u2019s complicated, exhausting, and requires real work\u2014not just wishful thinking.\n\nWhat makes it even worse is when the people who were supposed to protect you, love you, and be there for you were the ones who hurt you the most. When you grow up in emotional neglect or outright abuse, you don\u2019t just get over that. How do you just \u201cmove on\u201d from never feeling safe, from never having support, from having to parent yourself while the people around you acted like your suffering didn\u2019t exist?\n\nSome of us never had a safety net. We never had a support system. We never had people to turn to when things got bad. And then, on top of that, we\u2019re expected to function like everyone else, as if all of that didn\u2019t permanently alter our ability to trust, to connect, to feel okay in our own skin.\n\nI\u2019m tired of the oversimplification of mental health. I\u2019m tired of people who have no idea what it\u2019s like to live with CPTSD acting like they have all the answers. And I\u2019m really tired of being made to feel like my struggles are my fault.\n\nFor those of you who deal with this, how do you respond? How do you handle people who refuse to understand the complexity of trauma and mental health? Because right now, I am struggling to stay patient.\n\nThanks for letting me vent. I just needed to get this off my chest."

Being 19, I am in the age range where schizophrenia usually develops, and ever since this fear has entered my head, it\u2019s been making it difficult for me to sleep, concentrate, etc. Lately, every time I have a conversation with someone, I find myself ruminating about it and thinking about whether or not I was acting strange, talking weird, stuff like that. I\u2019ve talked to a few people about this, and they\u2019ve mentioned that it might be OCD, as I have had similar obsessions about different things in the past. But I just can\u2019t help but worry. I also was a chronic weed user for the past year, (I have quit now) and that fact has further exacerbated my anxiety, due to learning that weed use can trigger schizophrenia or psychosis. Additionally, I sometimes get episodes of depersonalization/derealization which makes me think I am losing my mind even more. \n\nI\u2019d like to hear what you guys think about this.

Maybe I misunderstood her, but it seemed to me like she was suggesting that everyone has problems and I could get some basic help but she doesn\u2019t think I need anything else for the time being.

Checked again as I called a nurse line, went to 200/130. Nurse said to call 911 so I did. In the ambulance my bp read at its most 237/130.

On top of that, the war started in my country, and in the past few years, I\u2019ve moved through five cities, two countries, and just a month ago, I moved to Toronto with my boyfriend, leaving my old life behind. We decided to adopt a kitten (I\u2019ve never had a pet before), and we brought her home five days ago. I\u2019ve been so anxious about potentially having those horrible obsessive thoughts again, especially about possibly causing harm to this little creature, that I ended up having a panic attack.\n\nShe\u2019s so small and innocent, and every time she meows or seems scared, I feel like a terrible person. I worry that I can\u2019t be a good cat owner, or that I should be happier than I am in this moment. She is perfect, beautiful and very smart cat. But adopting her wasn\u2019t a random decision - I\u2019ve dreamed of having a cat my whole life. I loved visiting friends with cats and even looked after them when they were on vacation. I have no issue with feeding her, cleaning the litter box, taking her to the vet - it's more about the emotional side of having a little animal who depends on me, and knowing I need to dedicate time to making her happy. So, I guess I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s happening with me, and whether I\u2019m a bad or a person with a serious mental disease because of these thoughts. Thank you so much for reading this, and sorry for the long message!\n\nPlease tell me that I'm not going crazy!:("

    "content": "Please, If you have any idea of why this is happening or if you have a suggestion that might help me, please, do.\n\nIt's hard to say with precision when this problem started. Officially, the first time I felt this way was about 5 years ago, but my psychologist believes it has been a problem for longer than that \u2014 and that most likely, I reached my limit and started to feel the problem as intensely as possible, all that was missing was a trigger.\n\nWhen I was 14 years old, I dated a girl during the pandemic. We didn't usually meet due to the circumstances and because of that, a part of our relationship was long distance. 3 months had gone by until we finally had the opportunity to see each other, I invited her to eat a burger at a relative's house and everything went well until the moment we sat down to eat. Everyone was sitting at the table and she was sitting next to me, I prepared my burger beforehand just the way I liked it to be done and I took the first bite. The feeling was immediate. I felt nauseous and dizzy, my body started to sweat and I felt that chill from when you lose something or someone important to you, it felt a lot like an anxiety attack, but it was much stronger. The last symptom was the urge to vomit, and I couldn't bear it. I ran to the bathroom and tried to calm myself down, and it was working until my girlfriend decided to check on me. As soon as she showed concern, it all came back. The situation was desperate. I was trying to relax, but her presence made it all come back and I had no idea what was happening. I think that I convinced her to leave me alone at that moment and I finally got to recover. The rest of the day felt like a blur, I felt exhausted and extremely weak without doing anything. I have never experienced anything like that in my entire life.\n\nAfter that day, every time my girlfriend or someone from my daily life showed affection towards me, I felt the same way I felt that day. It was bearable in some way, but it turned out to be unbearable when someone tried to touch me. Any slight attempt to touch me felt like torture. When it happened, I felt paralyzed. I couldn't move a muscle, I was petrified with discomfort and I struggled to control my thoughts. Everything I mentioned, as I said, was tolerable, the worst part was the urge to puke. Both times it occured, I was in a relationship and those were the worst days of my life. All it takes is words of affection or an attempt to touch me and I get triggered, my body responds instantly. Even when I'm distracted and free of worries, my body responds the same way. Vomiting has always been the \"highest stage\" of this reaction, and it is the moment I completely lose control of my mind and mind. I always think I'm going to die and it's exhausting to live like this. Within the relationship, I was never able to be alone with her again, always scared by the thought of being touched and feeling sick because of it. The only moment I felt safe around her, was when we were surrounded by other people. I was sure she wouldn't touch me without permission or in a more \"direct way\".\n\nIt is important to make it clear that she was NEVER invasive and that she always RESPECTED my boundaries, these thoughts only went thought my head as a way of trying to explain what was happening to me. We broke up later and remained as friends. The interesting part is that the issue suddenly disappeared, just like magic. Of course, sometimes I felt sick because I wasn't completely free of it, but it wasn't nearly as intense as before.\n\nOver the years, I learned to live with it. I avoided hugs, always said \"I love you\" before the person had the opportunity to say it first, ran away from family gatherings and adopted the image of a cold person to protect myself from any display of love and affection. It was tolerable for some time. Just like a virus, the issue began to \"mutate\" and affect even more areas of my life as the months gone by. Sometimes I had to stop talking to my friends and ask them for some time alone, because I couldn't stand the discomfort and the sickness. I could only stand the feeling when I was with my friend group and strangers, what was really bad was when my family and love interests were affectionately towards me. It was simply unbearable. I went to 4 psychologists before finding my current one, none of them paying attention to this dilemma. I went to my current psychologist only with the intention of resolving this issue, because it was staring to become difficult to live with such a problem. I made a lot of progress and I started to notice a few things. Whenever I felt bad, I was close to food. The first time it happened, I was eating, and every occurrence after that: I was eating, had just eaten, or was near food. If someone says something affectionate while I'm eating, I feel sick. It doesn't necessarily have to be an \"I love you\" or \"you're beautiful\", but what I understand as affection, which even involves jokes to make me laugh. As I said before, all of this is tolerable when it doesn't get out of hand, but when it affects my life to the point I can barely eat without feeling sick, it has become an urgency.\n\nA long time ago, I changed several habits of mine because if it, such as having lunch with my family, being touched by my girlfriend when I'm eating, having snacks with friends and, most recently, I started to skip lunch. Somehow, the issue ended up affecting even things that don't directly envolve affection or being touched. Just the thought of lunch being an activity known for bringing a family together is enough to make me feel sick. Any conception and construction I have about what love is, and how it can be expressed, is enough to mess up my life. With some people, it's even harder to control, especially because of the proximity we share, but mainly because of the trust issues. The first thought that comes to my mind is: \"if I ask this person to stop, will they respect my decision?\". I built a hierarchy of trust in my head, from the most complicated to the simplest to deal with: love interests, family, friends and strangers. The funny thing is, how come my mind thinks a stranger is more trustworthy than a partner?\n\nBecause of this idea, my psychologist suggested that I might have suffered some kind of abuse during childhood. Not necessarily sexual violence, but a \"simple\" psychological abuse while I was eating, which expands the range of hypotheses. For example, I may have heard someone swearing at me during lunch and it created a trauma. The bif issue is that I don't remember basically anything from my childhood, not even my traumas. These days, I've been having some trouble swallowing pills and dealing with strong emotions, always around food. I don't know what to do or what to think about it anymore, I just want to be free from this issue and go back to living normally."

    "title": "Breast cancer anxiety",
    "content": "Sorry, this is a long post. I don't want to look at another Google page, so this is me looking for comfort.\n\nWell, I (F43) guess I suffered from health anxiety from a very young age, but it's been okay for a really long time (even my family didn't notice).  Recently it's been getting really bad though. I was convinced I had a brain tumor or early onset Alzheimer's for almost a year, because my memory would be really bad at times. I still was functioning on a high cognitive level at work though and managed my household with 2 kids. So, I finally got an MRI a few months ago and that ruled out the tumor. I finally am getting over the fear of these horrible disease, even the Alzheimer's that isn't detectable in it's early form. \n\nI have been practicing DARE and it's techniques really help me. I also noticed my cycle has a huge influence and my hypothesis is that I'm in my perimenopause, which would also explain the memory lapses. As well as the fear!\n\nMy new thing is a pain I started having in my right breast. It lasted for a week or two and would sting. I was becoming more worried over time, but also told myself it was probably also hormones so wait till your period start. Well, my period started and the pain was gone. But I noticed there was a lump in the center of my breast, just below where the pain would be before. This lump feels large and long (not round, more like an oval disc) and I can feel it best when I lift my arm. \n\nBecause of the memory issues I got B12 injections and I had to make a doctor's appointment to order new. I figured I would get a look at the lump, while I'm there and I told myself to not worry any longer if the doc told me it was fine. The anxiety was pretty manageable until the appointment, because I told myself I would take the reassurance if it was offered. So far, so good.\n\nThe doctor felt the lump but called it small (I feel like I feel it a lot better and it feels really big, but I wasn't putting my arm up while he felt it, stupid I know). And because I have no more symptoms like leakage or dents, and no family history of breast cancer, he wasn't worried. He told me that if it doesn't grow and there are no other symptoms, I don't have to come back for it. His guess was it was hormones related.\n\nWell, I woke up the next morning (yesterday) in total anxiety mode. I took a shower and felt like the lump was twice it's size, but I realized it was just the same as yesterday. Because I felt like I had to fix this fear right away, I emailed my doctor telling him I would like to get a referral to the hospital for a proper exam anyway (they make an ultrasound or mammography at the hospital, but I need a referral). He hasn't responded (will probably do so tomorrow because they try in 2 days) and I've been checking my phone over and over again today, fearing he might deny me the exam. I was totally obsessed. I have a wonderful doctor who listens really good, so I don't know why he would do so, but still..\n\nTo top it off I looked up the waiting times for hospitals today and they are up to 16 days. That's way too long, so now I have anxiety over the amount of anxiety I'm going to have for the coming weeks, even if my doc says yes. Everywhere I read (I know google is hell, but I can't help myself) it says breast cancer grows really fast. So 16 days feels like it could make it all so bad it can't be treated anymore.\n\nHealth anxiety really sucks! The problem with health anxiety for me is that I live in a country where the GP doesn't order exams or check ups easily, and I need proper reassurance from such a check, before I can get to the 'acceptance of fear' fase. All programs start with 'if you have been properly looked at by a medical professional, you know you don't really have this issue you fear.' But what if you feel like you are not properly looked at?\n\nI guess I will have to accept the fact that I might die from some disease that could have been detected earlier or could have been treatable. If I'm at that stage I'm finally at the End Boss Level of kicking my anxiety to the curb. \n\nCan anyone relate? Any guidance?"

Do you know any calming beta blockers that are less likely to cause hair loss?  \n\n\nEdit: I asked ChatGPT about it, here is the answer if anyone else is wondering about the question:\n\n\"Some beta-blockers have a lower risk of causing hair loss compared to others. Hair loss is a possible side effect of beta-blockers, but it is not very common. If you are concerned about hair loss, it may be worth discussing with your doctor the possibility of switching to a beta-blocker that has fewer reports of this side effect. Here are some options:\n\n# 1. Beta-blockers with a lower risk of hair loss:\n\n* **Nebivolol (e.g., Bystolic):** Nebivolol is a selective beta-blocker that may have milder side effects compared to non-selective beta-blockers like propranolol. It is often used for high blood pressure and has been reported to cause less hair loss.\n* **Atenolol:** Atenolol is another selective beta-blocker that may have a lower risk of hair-related side effects than some others.\n* **Bisoprolol:** Bisoprolol is also selective and could be an option if hair loss is a concern.\n\n# 2. Beta-blockers with a higher risk of hair loss:\n\n* **Propranolol:** Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker and is more commonly associated with hair loss as a side effect.\n* **Metoprolol:** Although metoprolol is selective, some people have reported hair loss as a side effect.\n\n# Why can beta-blockers cause hair loss?\n\nHair loss can occur because beta-blockers may affect the growth cycle of hair follicles, causing more follicles to enter the resting phase (telogen effluvium). This leads to temporary hair shedding rather than permanent loss.\n\n\\>Are those as calming as Propranolol?\n\nIt depends on the effect you are looking for, as different beta-blockers have slightly different profiles in how they work on the body. Here is a comparison of the calming properties of the beta-blockers we mentioned:\n\n# 1. Propranolol \u2013 The Most Calming\n\n* **Mechanism of action**: Propranolol is a **non-selective beta-blocker**, meaning it affects both beta-1 (heart) and beta-2 (lungs, blood vessels) receptors.\n* **Calming effect**: Propranolol is often used to manage anxiety, especially performance anxiety, as it blocks the physical symptoms of stress (e.g., heart palpitations, tremors, and sweating).\n* **Note**: It also crosses the blood-brain barrier, which contributes to its calming effect.\n\n# 2. Nebivolol \u2013 Less Calming\n\n* **Mechanism of action**: Nebivolol is a **selective beta-1 blocker**, meaning it primarily works on the heart and has minimal effects on beta-2 receptors.\n* **Calming effect**: It is generally milder and less sedating than propranolol because it doesn\u2019t affect the nervous system in the same way. However, it can help reduce physical symptoms of anxiety, though perhaps not as effectively as propranolol.\n\n# 3. Atenolol \u2013 Less Calming\n\n* **Mechanism of action**: Atenolol is also a **selective beta-1 blocker**.\n* **Calming effect**: Atenolol has a weaker effect on the nervous system and does not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily as propranolol. This makes it less effective for managing anxiety-related symptoms.\n\n# 4. Bisoprolol \u2013 Similar to Nebivolol and Atenolol\n\n* **Mechanism of action**: Bisoprolol is also a **selective beta-1 blocker**.\n* **Calming effect**: Its effect on anxiety is mild, similar to Nebivolol and Atenolol. It is effective at lowering heart rate but less \u201ccalming\u201d in terms of affecting the central nervous system.\n\n# Summary: How Calming Are They in Comparison?\n\n* **Propranolol**: The most calming and the best choice for managing anxiety-related symptoms.\n* **Nebivolol, Atenolol, Bisoprolol**: Less calming and primarily effective for heart-related symptoms (e.g., high blood pressure or palpitations) but less noticeable for anxiety.\n\n\""

Then a Lyft driver (outsourced by the medical transport) taking me to therapy asked if I've had an accident. After I said I have anxiety for other stuff and the anxiety got worse from a D&D player wrongfully blowing up on me the week before, the driver said he noticed a pattern and that I need to not worry about what other people are doing (like a driver in the car) and should try immersive therapy like if I was scared of spiders, I should go in a tub of 100 spiders to see they're not hurting me and get over my fear.\n\nThen an old coworker from over a decade responded to my Facebook post about having sat in the same seat as me at a tea place. She then messaged me asking how I was doing. I said I had anxiety and was unpacking a lot in therapy. She then asked if I knew the root of my anxiety, which she figured out for herself.

I\u2019m accomplishing things that would normally take me months: I enrolled in a German course (even though I\u2019ve lived here for a while and only know the basics), earned a tech certification in just a week, and I wake up with real motivation to get work done. The motivation for the gym has dropped a little, but I\u2019m still going.\n\nThat said, I stumbled upon this subreddit today and started to feel a bit anxious about the medication. I wondered if this treatment would eventually normalize my brain to the point where I could stop taking meds. Some people seem to stay on them for years, and I was concerned after reading about withdrawal experiences. But after reflecting on how much better I\u2019ve been feeling these past three weeks, I\u2019m choosing to focus on the positives. I\u2019ll continue with my treatment, and once I find a new doctor, I plan to discuss my options further. As of now it has been life changing honestly."

I only ever feel the will to do things in groups and it becomes difficult even then. \n\nAre there are any good coping mechanisms or ways to regain my willpower?

The doctor and a physical therapist both told me that my anxiety is probably making me have crazy muscle tension on my left side including my back which is probably the reason for the chest pains. \n\nAnytime my HR goes up when I\u2019m working (physical labor) during the day I get a weird feeling.

    "content": "I'm in a remote part of Africa right now, and I got some Xanax over-the-counter to take for my anxiety. It\u2019s easily available from pharmacies without a prescription. I've been having issues sleeping, and when I do get some sleep, usually just a few hours, when I wake up I start to panic. And so, I thought this medication could potentially help me out, even though I have never taken it. I'm also a little hesitant to take it because I don't know how I would react to it, and if I were to have an adverse reaction, or God forbid, some type of medical emergency, I would not get proper care here even though it's a very low dosage, and there's very little chance of anything major happening to me. \n\nEither way, I keep it with me at all times just in case my symptoms become unmanageable. I've become really emotionally reliant on having access to this medication though. So anytime I go somewhere, especially if I'm going out to the town, or going places where I'm not very familiar with, I take it with me just as a backup because I have experienced a little bit of panicky feelings when I go outside. I noticed that when I lose the medication or misplace it, I literally start to freak out. My legs start to shake, and I get the gut-punching feelings in my stomach. Once I find the medication, the symptoms resolve. Again, I haven\u2019t taken it so there\u2019s no mental reference point for me to say it\u2019s actually helpful but I guess I get comfort from knowing that I have a powerful option should I need it. I have not reached the threshold yet because I\u2019ve been able to manage my anxiety through sleep, breathing techniques and exercise. \n\nLong story short, I\u2019ve become emotionally dependent on having Xanax with me (panicking whenever I can\u2019t find it) even though I\u2019ve never taken it. It brings me comfort knowing I have a safety net if my symptoms become unmanageable. It\u2019s strange, I know, but it just shows that I probably have a lot of underlying anxiety issues that aren\u2019t just about the Xanax itself. "

It\u2019s waiting for the other shoe to drop, so it\u2019s like I\u2019m unconsciously making it drop first.\n\nIt\u2019s like this everything, a job, relationship, and thing. For example, with job, I\u2019ve been constantly refreshing LinkedIn, deactivated it, then reactivated it, then deactivated again, because my brain is telling me to start looking for a new job now just in case I get laid off. Even though there\u2019s no real sign that I will, my mind just won\u2019t shut up about it. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t sit still because if I\u2019m not preparing for disaster, I feel unsafe. The same was with my past relationship, like I already prepared myself that this wouldn\u2019t last just by looking at the signs so I can just be one step ahead every time. \n\nI don\u2019t even enjoy what I\u2019ve accomplished because I\u2019m already thinking about what\u2019s next, how to stay ahead, how to make sure I never have to deal with inconveniences. Like, instead of just feeling okay in my job, I\u2019m obsessing over what if I get laid off? and trying to control a future that hasn\u2019t even happened.\n\nHas anyone else felt this?

    "content": "I\u2019ve struggled with OCD, anxiety, depression, and knee injuries requiring multiple surgeries since childhood. After a college knee injury and surgery, my mental health worsened, and my OCD became unbearable. I graduated in 2016, worked briefly as a teacher, but left due to worsening symptoms. In 2017, I was accepted into grad school but postponed enrollment to care for my father, who passed away from cancer later that year. Despite worsening knee pain, I delayed treatment to prioritize his care. After his passing, I had my third surgery in December 2017. During recovery, a severe bike accident during physical therapy led to a fourth surgery, disrupting my plans for grad school. That summer, I was bedridden and in the worst sustained pain of my life. I informed the University about the surgery, told them I would arrive late, and asked for help catching up, but received no response. For two months, I was on crutches, wearing a brace, and struggled with moving to a new apartment and school in a new state. Knee pain and instability persisted, leaving me increasingly behind.\"\n\nMy OCD and depression became unbearable every time I tried to study. Grad school coursework builds on concepts from the last years of college, but those years were extremely traumatic for me. Studying turned into reliving past trauma, leaving me depressed and exhausted. I sought help from the University mental health center, but they only offered one 30-minute therapy session per month, which wasn\u2019t enough. I also tried connecting with other grad students to work in groups, as group work helps ease my OCD symptoms, but those efforts were unsuccessful.\n\n\"I registered with the campus disability center and requested accommodations for extra time on assignments, but my request was ignored, and I was dismissed from the program. I appealed, providing medical records of my surgeries, mental health struggles, frequent illnesses likely caused by medication prescribed by a university doctor, and records of hospital visits, physical therapy, and orthopedic consultations for ongoing knee issues. Despite this, my appeal was denied, likely because a professor falsely claimed I had never submitted any assignments.\n\nI returned home in mid-2019 broken and inconsolable. Feeling mistreated, I spent months trying to make sense of my removal and compose a complaint, but my OCD made the process excruciating. Revisiting the events triggered extreme depression, leaving me unable to function. The process drove me to suicidal thoughts, forcing me to take it slowly. Eventually, after several months, I completed the complaint and filed it with the Office for Civil Rights.\n\n**Filing with OCR**  \nI filed a complaint with OCR, explaining that my five-month delay was due to disability-related reasons. I provided detailed documentation of my medical conditions, surgeries, and mental health struggles, along with expert testimony on the incapacitating effects of my OCD. According to OCR\u2019s manual, exceptions for lateness are allowed in such cases, but despite waiting two years, they rejected my case as \u201ctoo late.\u201d They refused to explain why they ignored the exception and offered no further justification, mirroring the same disregard shown by my university.\n\n**Turning to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office**  \nFollowing advice from a disability advocacy group, I filed a complaint with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. They claimed their denial was unrelated to the lateness or complexity of my case but refused to provide a specific reason, citing resource limitations. I suggested narrowing my case and using existing documentation to reduce their workload, but they still declined. They never asked how my condition impacted my academic performance or the timeliness of my actions, making their response feel like systemic disregard rather than a genuine resource issue.\n\n**What I Need Help With**  \nI feel systematically dismissed by these institutions, which seem to use pretexts to avoid taking my case. I suspect they don\u2019t view my conditions as true disabilities, which in itself is a form of discrimination. With significant prosecutorial discretion, these agencies can decide which complaints to pursue, and their decisions are nearly impossible to challenge.\n\nI\u2019ve also reached out to my Congressman and Senators\u2019 offices for advocacy, but they seem to lack understanding or interest, leaving me with no progress. Has anyone had positive outcomes engaging with lawmakers in cases like this?\n\nI\u2019m seeking advice on:\n\n1. **Disability discrimination cases** \u2013 Is this pattern of rejection common, and how can I hold these institutions accountable?\n2. **Advocacy efforts** \u2013 How can I better advocate for myself or find someone to champion my case?\n3. **Systemic issues** \u2013 Are there organizations tackling systemic disregard for disabilities in education and legal systems?\n\nAny guidance would mean a lot. I\u2019m at a loss for how to ensure my disabilities are taken seriously.  \nThank you for your support."

    "content": "I give up.\n\nI don't know if this is progress or harmful, but I do not care. I am done. I have spent the last ten years of my life fighting dental anxiety. I went back to the dentist for the first time in years at twelve and it started out manageable but then a couple bad experiences combined with other traumas and my own personality drove it up the wall. I haven't been in four years. I have spent those years obsessing over any sensation in my teeth, searching the Internet, talking to people about dentists, and guilt-tripping myself and shaming myself and desperately trying to force myself to go.\n\nI give up. Pre-gap, I canceled appointments before because I was throwing up in the car midway through a panic attack. I spent an entire vacation obsessing over the location of dentist's offices. I've done DIY exposure therapy multiple times. I had the world's greatest dentist - still nothing. No trust, no tolerance. Not only did I leave the office sobbing hysterically, but I sprinted half a mile away in full fight-or-flight mode.\n\nThis entire time I've been trying to live up to my own (and my parents') standards. Just go to the dentist. Just go to the dentist. Stop being such a baby, grow up and go to the dentist. Everyone does it. Get over it. Get over yourself.\n\nYeah, well, I give up. I found a new dentist with amazing reviews who does sedation dentistry for anxious patients. Next time I sit in the dental chair to get work done, I am doing it with an IV in my arm. I am going to make an appointment for an exam, see what I need, and then ask the dentist to schedule a time to knock me out and get it done. No more lying in the chair trembling violently, too afraid to speak, dissociating so heavily I am watching myself from above. No more crying myself to sleep, no more sleepless nights. What am I even trying to prove? Why is it so important to me that I can overcome my fear of the dentist? What, am I supposed to be a better person because I can sit through a root canal?\n\nNo. Screw that. Knock me the f\\*ck out and spare me the suffering. Dental phobia, you win this round, but you don't get to mess with the rest of my life. I'm not any less of a man because my nervous system's got a thing about dentists, and I am done listening to people who say I am."

I had a MRI scan last year in June for other reasons so I know my GP won\u2019t give me another but the pain is really bad.

There\u2019s no opportunity for me to thrive or develop. I want to start my adult life and be the man I want to be by getting away from my old life. \n\u201cThen just move if you\u2019re so unhappy!\u201d\nBut I live in the middle of nowhere (population ~1,000 people) and don\u2019t have the ability to get my license. I CAN drive, but not publicly due to a fear of laws, cops and other drivers, and navigating through the city. So I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I just might not have the ability to drive and I\u2019m sure I can figure out the transit system and can literally walk anywhere that I need to get to. Getting a job would be hard to get since some businesses require it for insurance too. \nI know that everything I want/need is outside of my bubbled town but I just don\u2019t have the ability to leave it. It\u2019s slowly driving me crazy (and will admit have done terrible things to stay sated) due to outliving my expectations since I\u2019ve been suicidal since childhood and the only thing that saved me was going to high school outside of my community and being able to discover my true self. \n\nHell, I\u2019ve tried running away a couple years ago (as an adult) but was ratted out by my community members to my Mom who found and brought me back. Realized I\u2019ve never told her how much I loathe staying here, since everyone around me thinks I just love it (which I do, just hate the people here). Probably because I keep my feelings to myself, as I don\u2019t trust them with other people, especially my family. \n\nI\u2019ve tried therapy in the past to get better but it never worked/stayed consistent, due to not being able to get to the sessions and my poor communication skills. Did try some meds but didn\u2019t work for me either. \nSo I\u2019m at a loss as to what to do to improve myself enough to gain a happier life. \n\nYet now what? Being too afraid to even start a life. There are so many factors that make up my struggles that it would be a long, sad and pathetic rant. Maybe it\u2019s just me being at a loss at what to do. \nI\u2019d appreciate the advice and if you need more context just let me know. "

For more context my main issue is usually not falling asleep but staying asleep as I will be partially sleeping but aware I\u2019m not getting restful sleep/semi conscious basically the entire night. Alternatively I fall asleep temporarily and then my body somewhat wakes up to the point where I have dreams but long ones that last hours and don\u2019t give me any restful sleep. I haven\u2019t slept in two days because I just started my spring semester of grad school but I can\u2019t live like this. Was really challenging last semester too when I couldn\u2019t sleep at all the night before any of my final exams. I\u2019ve taken meds of various sorts but have not found much that has helped - melatonin just makes me more tired but doesn\u2019t put me to sleep and anxiety meds like Xanax are surprisingly unhelpful and don\u2019t do anything for my sleep. I also exercise regularly and have a standard schedule where I wake up and go to sleep at pretty consistent times everyday which used to be very helpful but doesn\u2019t do much on days when the anxiety is overwhelming. Desperate for a solution and I am so tired pls help x "

I decided to go to a psychiatrist because of some issues I just can\u2019t take anymore. I was diagnosed with OCD which kinda confused me as I don\u2019t know too much about it. I haven\u2019t been able to get more than 3-6 hours of sleep for two years. My brain won\u2019t shut off and I have racing thoughts about things I need to get done that are stressing me out or scenarios that could happen, concerns about my brother and his family, concerns about my future, my dog, past experiences that I read into and wonder what they\u2019re emotions towards me we\u2019re. I am so tired but just can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019ve tried lots of things except prescription meds because I wanted to get the source. It\u2019s takes me about 3 days of no sleep for me to randomly be sitting on the couch or in a chair and I\u2019ll wake up to my Partner saying \"you were asleep like that for 3 hours\". If I clean for long hours, basically exhausting myself, I\u2019m able to lay down and sleep for about 6 hours but I wake up on the hour with my heart beating like I\u2019m anxious. I feel like most the time I have no personality or purpose and nothing brings me joy. Then I randomly get these bursts of energy like I can\u2019t sit still have to clean or run and there a million thoughts going through my head and I feel like I could be some big shot CEO and build a house \ud83d\ude02 something my partner pointing out was that if someone says something or something happens that give some even the slightest negative emotion I just spiral and start thinking about how hopeless I am. I am so mentally exhausted and the only thing that keeps me going is that I have to be here for my partner and my pup dog. I repeat to myself that I just need to bite my tongue and wait this out until I have burst of energy and happiness again. I am also very organized. Not in the head, that\u2019s all over the place \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05 but my room is spotless and precise and I can\u2019t live without my multiple notebooks that I write lists for everything in/journaling. I\u2019ll write a list of things to do when I\u2019m hyper and then feel so overwhelmed and unmotivated after that hyper feeling goes away. I\u2019m only a little bothered with germs, I don\u2019t let my partner kiss the top of my hand, touch my face, or I\u2019ll clean his cup really well so there\u2019s no germs on it. I\u2019m just worried that he might get sick. I definitely get really anxious over talking to people but as soon as I do I become this charismatic person that knows how to ask the right questions and keep the person talking about themselves to make them like me even though I find talking to people kind of unbearable:/ I apologize that this is so long and I appreciate anyone who reads this or even makes it this far. I\u2019m also Sorry it\u2019s all over the place \ud83d\ude05 This is my first time being diagnosed with anything/seeking help. My family never hugs or says I love you so talking about emotions feels wrong and I\u2019m nervous about this whole process. I\u2019ve been prescribed Fluvoxamine and have a follow up in a month so we\u2019ll see how it goes!"

If my anxiety got too bad, I took one, and calmed down in time. My anxiety seemed to be less frequent due to no stress from work, and when I did have it, the medicine paired with healthier coping mechanisms seemed to make it manageable.\n\nToday I started back at school. I\u2019ve been out of school for years for this exact reason - anxiety and depression made it too much. But I decided to go back, because I don\u2019t want to be stuck working minimum wage jobs that don\u2019t pay enough to support myself and move out and all. However, it\u2019s day one, and it\u2019s already going terribly\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve had six panic attacks today, in less than twelve hours. During my second attack, I took my medicine, it helped for a little, and then\u2026 BOOM. Another stressful thing happened and triggered it again, and I couldn\u2019t stay calm. I\u2019m supposed to only take my medicine once every six hours as needed, so obviously I didn\u2019t take a second one when I\u2019d literally JUST taken one thirty minutes prior. I continued to have my fourth panic attack, got through it, and then\u2026 about four hours after taking it, a fifth panic attack. I decided to try and take a second dose, since it had been a while and I\u2019m in the lowest dosage, and well\u2026 it wasn\u2019t helping. So I went back to my old habit of self harming, and that calmed me down for a bit\u2026 until I had a sixth one just now.\n\nWhat do I do? I don\u2019t know what to do. Why does nothing help? I can\u2019t drop out - I\u2019ve already taken thousands out on a student loan. I can\u2019t not have a job. I need something to work to support myself. But what?\n\nWhy does nothing help me? Why does everything make me anxious? Why do I have panic attacks so bad that I can\u2019t breathe, can\u2019t speak, can\u2019t move - can\u2019t function or do anything at all?

    "content": "So I know it\u2019s not a good idea at all but the only thing that helps me stay asleep is my prescribed Clonozapam and NyQuil at night. \nCan anyone else relate? So I take 1 mg of Klonopin in the morning which I\u2019ve been on for 15 years already but now to stay asleep is the problem my psychiatrist is telling me to take two Klonopin at night but that would be 3 mg daily and I don\u2019t wanna be on that much Bentil, I tried taking one Klonopin at night and it won\u2019t do nothing. I have to take a dose of NyQuil along with it so I can stay asleep. Otherwise I literally wake up every hour and can\u2019t go to sleep. This is no way to live. I have a 4 1/2 year-old that I have to take care of along with my two older children who are adults. My anxiety is that debilitating due to severe past DV trauma and etc. I would appreciate any suggestions or tips of how to possibly stay asleep. I\u2019ve tried a lot of things that people take and it just doesn\u2019t work for me. My Dr just prescribed me Ambien 10 mg and it didn\u2019t do a thing except make me wake up every hour on the dot I believe my gabba receptors and nervous system is so jacked up from being on the Klonopin for 15 years already. I am afraid now that what I\u2019m doing even though it is helping it\u2019s gonna end up messing me up severely. I already grew tolerance to the NyQuil when I was taking it for a month during the holidays just so I can make Christmas happen. I\u2019ve been stop taking NyQuil and I was just taking Benadryl with my Klonopin, but it still doesn\u2019t have the effect that the NyQuil does idk why, but the NyQuil along with the Klonopin is like magic except we all know what\u2019s gonna end up happening. I\u2019m gonna grow tolerance like I did prior. I stopped taking NyQuil for about a week, and I literally couldn\u2019t stay asleep for 2 days. If  I don\u2019t sleep, I can\u2019t get anything done yet let alone take care of my home and do anything that needs to be done HELPPPP!!!"

I have powered through 2 presentations with it but they were both shorter (around 1 minute) and less important. I almost got a anxiety attack in front of the class but managed to barely stay calm, but im worried that i wont manage this time. The presentation is longer and as soon as I step in front of my class my heart start pounding and I start sweating and shaking profusely. This affects my performance and I am scared that I will let my group down but more importantly I will freeze in front of the class from fear and embarris myself really bad. I absolutely have to go and it is stressing me out really bad 2 days in advance. Its fucking up my sleep and I know that that will just make the fear worse. I have gotten a few tips from my doctor but I don't think that will be enough. My current plan is bringing a water bottle full of alcohol to school and drinking some beforhand to soothe my nerves. I know that that is a terrible solution but i really dont want to fuck up in front of my class so it seems like the only option. If i screw up I will be hearing that for a long time in my class.

I started online school a few months back because my anxiety got so bad I could only go to school around 1 day a week, but tomorrow I have to go in to complete some practical work for my exams. because school was the source of my anxiety and because I haven\u2019t been there for so long, I literally forgot how bad my anxiety could actually get so quickly. because I was by myself at home I forgot about how sad and depressed I felt for months. my throat is already closed up and thats something I havent felt in a long time. waking up nauseous every morning, not able to eat and crying the night before a school day was normal for me for years and that makes me so sad to think about now. looking at photos my school posts and seeing everyone so normal and capable of just.. attending is such a deflating feeling. such a simple thing, but not for me. I already decided after typing this out that I\u2019m not going to go in and I would much rather loose out on the exam marks than feel like this for even a minute so it\u2019s decided and I\u2019m literally typing this with snot everywhere from crying for the last 15 minutes how am I ever going to pass my final exams without antidepressants that work\n\nbefore people start commenting things yes I have a designated clean study space, yes I fixed my diet, yes I went to multiple doctors for a medication to help (first one wouldn\u2019t prescribe anything because I was under 18, and the second one let me try lexapro which had no effect whatsoever so he took me off it and suggests I \u201cpick up a sport\u201d), I even started journalling recently but none of these things help me long term \n\nI think whats wrong is I have celiac disease which is causing over 35 symptoms in my case and the worst is anxiety, but my doctor is not very helpful \n\nliterally every single \u201cremedy\u201d you name it I\u2019ve tried it. magnesium and iron supplements, ashwaghanda supplements and drops, lions mane drops, rescue remedy, I discovered that I\u2019m low in vitamin B and D from a blood test at the doctors so I\u2019ve been taking those for a few months, I added things like chia seeds and apple cider vinegar to my diet daily, removed processed sugar, and after all of this nothing helped, lexapro only gave me night sweats and extremely violent gory nightmares\n\nI have an appointment with a gastroenterologist soon so hopefully I\u2019ll figure out what\u2019s causing my anxiety and I can move from there "

I pushed through it but I\u2019ve always had a fear ever since of slepeing sounds dumb but I\u2019m wondering if this is common. I\u2019ve had really bad sleep last few weeks and was up for 30+hours on Tuesday last week.

Few times but got up about 4pm and went to work. Then Monday I couldn\u2019t sleep until 6-7 and I got woken up at 7:45 by my mum and I went back to slepe for about an hour unsure whether I have slept or not. Then I left college early and went for a nap where I slept 2 hours awoke for 30 mins because I had a vivid mind of nightmare not a nightmare but just feeling like panicky in my dream. Then I went back to slepe for another 2 hours after being awake for 20 mins and same thing. Then I stayed up from that nap at 12-5 then stayed up until 1:30 because I was afraid of slepeing and went to sleep and I woke up about 7:30 7:45 and tried to go back to sleep for an hour until about 8:30 but I don\u2019t think I did and it felt like I didn\u2019t sleep but I\u2019ve been obsessing over it all day and thinking I\u2019m about to pass out from exhaustion.Now I\u2019m sat here panicking and my dpdr is worse then ever making me wonder what is slepe and what if I don\u2019t wake up or get sleep paralysis sort if this triggers anyone.

    "title": "Anxiety attacks hit me about a month ago now...",
    "content": "So I'm going to try and go indepth about this. Just because I need some reassurance more than anything. But also to see if what I'm feeling/experiencing is normal. \n\nDuring December about two weeks before Christmas was when the attack started, two weeks before that I was working, I'm a supervisor at an ALF, I work very hands on and I experienced my first loss while working there. The patient I weren't close, but it was my floor(only started about four months ago). And I'm not sure if this a contributing factor. My father passed when I was 19, and he just dropped. From what my mom said he woke up from a nap, asked where the cigarettes were and was just gone. This is definitely something that's bothered me as I was in nursing school at the time, but I was away visiting my aunt and cousins. \n\nThe first attack started with an intense feeling of impending doom. I think it was sparked by a video I watched right after I woke up, about an incident a paramedic had with a patient. And how they were having a panic attack, and were fighting to get out of the ambulance. And once they got their patient to the hospital they essentially dropped dead. A few hours later I had a dump of adrenaline from a game then felt this impending doom just cover me. Ended up holding on to my roommates father's leg for dear life. He's been there for me since my father passed. And he's been helping me through this. \n\nThe next one I had was in my car, I was trying to get somewhere and I hit a red light, I got agitated and the next thing I know my heart is trying to break my rib cage, I'm hyperventilating, and my hands and feet are pins and needles to the point I got out of my car to seek help because I thought I was having a heart attack. Luckily someone I knew was in the car behind me, and they helped me catch my breath and sat with me for about 10 minutes at this light till I could drive again. This would happen again but I caught myself and started breathing through it. And manage to get to where I'm going. \n\nI had another come on when I took an antibiotic without eating and lost all feeling in my stomach. Ended up having an intense reaction again and nearly passed out, black reaching the edges of my eyes, whole body was pins and needles. And I'm hyperventilating again. one of my roommates gets ice and hands it to me and tells me to put it on my neck and it almost completely stops and about all of five seconds. \n\nSince then I've been getting better at catching the little signs of an on coming panic attack I'll go grab some ice and start breathing through it. It happens a lot after I eat, and seems to be when I have gas, like a belch will flow up my throat and make my heart flutter and I'll start to panic. A lot of my anxiety seems to be centered around my heart. \n\nI seem to be dissociating a lot, and derealizating as well. I'll be moving my hand and know I did that, but when I look at my hand I'm like that's not right. My back seems to be extremely tight and causes my arms to feel extremely awkward, like they are floating and not really attached to my body. I'm zoning out a lot, and seeing more spots on my vision then normal. Like when you stare at a bright light for to long and the spot the light was travels with your eye sight for a moment. Heart palpitations are setting me off too.  And while I don't feel like I'm experiencing brain fog, it feels like only half my brain is working. I've felt no real pain when these attacks happen, at least from what I can tell. \n\nToday I twisted while picking something up at work, and my torso hurt for less then a second and that set me off. I had a few moments of intense want to run away, and the feeling felt like it was radiating through my body. But the panic attack last about 30 mins before the feelings pasted. The first three panic attacks I had lasted hours. And left me feeling wrong for days. Even now I don't feel completely like myself. \n\nThis is a long post, and I appreciate anyone who makes it through. I've never experienced anything like this before, and I'm terrified. "

Briefly in my room and in a hotel room (but this one is solved by getting up and just walking around for a bit and making the air cooler) And even at a busy restaurant where there was loud music. (I went to the bathroom a ton just to get fresh air and move to distract myself)\n\nI\u2019ve noticed in some of the situations my feet and sometimes my legs feel a bit odd, kind of like the pin and needles falling asleep feeling. Sometimes that starts before the rest of the symptoms. (And yes I do try and do foot exercises and leg exercises in the plane and when I\u2019m sitting for a long time to try and keep them from falling asleep)\n\nAre these just signs of panic or anxiety attacks? I just don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re happening. I\u2019m perfectly fine and then feel ill. I\u2019m wondering if it might be some type of medical condition. But it happens so out of the blue and rarely it makes me doubt. My biggest concern is on planes since I can\u2019t actually get off a plane to get fresh air and sometimes we can\u2019t get up from our seats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The main issue is my sleep & insomnia - I am waking up in the night every night for hours and hours having anxiety attacks. My doctor was very reluctant to give these to me but I managed to convince them as I have no other option. He told me to take them as and when needed. Is it a good idea to take these before I go to sleep? I obviously don't know how long it'll take me to feel the effects of the medication, which is why I am afraid if I don't take it before bed then I'd wake up, take a tablet, and it'd take ages for it to work. With the insomnia every night I am waking up with anxiety attacks for about 2-3 hours. It often says online to take them a few hours before a triggering event also. But i'd say the main problem currently with the anxiety is sleeping. "

I stress a lot as I am new and I don't like the work I am doing. I have very little knowledge in my field and won't have a lot of time to study from scratch. Every morning I wake up with anxiety attack and have poor sleep due to the stress. I can't leave my job due to responsibilities.I am scared of my future thinking what if I can't do the job because I have zero confidence in myself as knowledge is confidence. I can't fake or manage at my work as this is important. Previously due to the same anxiety and stress I left my job and all that converted to a traumatic experience to me. Now again I feel the same trauma and stress.I am just 26F I have financial issues and I have no addiction issues. Due to anxiety I am not able to segregate my thoughts and not able to work. I tried many methods to reduce my anxiety but nothing is helping me. I also have social anxiety and I am introverted to core. I don't know how to get help as I am new to this city. I have no friends here. I am not able to enjoy the moment I am in. I don't want this situation to lead me to depression, there is a high chance for it to happen.

It doesn\u2019t hurt when I take a deep breathe in or exercise. I also had an endoscopy done late December and they said everything was normal.

    "content": "Hey everyone, I\u2019ve been friends with three girls (A, I, C) for four years, and we\u2019re in our last year of high school. For context, I\u2019m the only one who is overweight, they are all very skinny. For as long as I\u2019ve known them, I\u2019ve never eaten in front of them\u2014whether we\u2019re at a restaurant or hanging out, I always just order water. They\u2019ve never really asked why, except for friend A, who has commented a couple of times. I\u2019ve always been defensive or brushed it off.\n\nI think I feel embarrassed to eat in front of them because I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s overweight and I care about their opinions, so I avoid eating around them. Because of this, I\u2019ve even turned down trips with them in the past and made up excuses, which has created tension.\n\nNow, we\u2019re planning a trip to a different in september 2025 after we finish our exams. I agreed to go last year, hoping that by the time the trip comes, I\u2019ll have lost enough weight to feel comfortable eating with them. But now, I\u2019m not so sure. C has already started planning the trip, and we\u2019re talking about hotels and places to visit. I feel like this issue might come up soon, especially since R or D might ask some questions about my eating habits. I\u2019m stuck and don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve thought of two options:\n\n1. Tell them in the near future (a few weeks or a month before the trip) about my food-related problem and how it could affect the trip. This would give them time to decide if they\u2019re okay with it. My idea is that I could eat separately from them at restaurants, but it could be tough to find different places to eat every day.\n2. Tell them right before the trip (a few weeks before), hoping they won\u2019t mind and that they understand. I\u2019m worried that A might have a problem with this. I would suggest the option of eating at different restaurants if needed, but I\u2019m not sure how that will go.\n\nI don\u2019t really talk about my problems or feelings, so having this conversation would be really REALLY difficult for me. Out of the three of them, I\u2019m especially worried about A because she might not be understanding and could even dismiss my problem. If she decides she doesn't want me to come anymore, I wouldn't blame her. Also, A has asked me multiple times to join trips or go to different places, but I always declined.\n\nI would love to go, but I don't know if it's possible.\n\nWhat should I do? Should I bring it up soon or wait until the trip gets closer? Or should I just drop the trip?\n\nThank you!"

Today after my doctors appointment I was told that I have \u201csevere anxiety disorder and panic disorder\u201d I also go into full blown panic when trying to sleep (that\u2019s fairly new) anyways I just kind of assumed everyone walked around feeling a since of doom and fight or flight type feelings just thought it was a universal thing but apparently it\u2019s not. I thought this whole part of me was a \u201cquirk\u201d and that it was good because it allowed me to put ungodly amounts of pressure to excel at work/tasks because idle made me feel uneasy and stressed. How do I cope and heal from something that at this point has become a tool for me albeit an unhealthy one. The dr wanted to put me on medication and I declined for the time being and tonight going to check for therapists inside of my insurance if that\u2019s even an option. Also the doctor recommended journaling. Any other recommendations? Sorry for rambling I feel pretty alone in this and don\u2019t have anyone to talk with "

I saw one called \"Breaking free of Child anxiety & OCD\" by Eli Lebowitz.\n\n\nOur child loves her daycare, teachers and friends there. She enjoys her friends who we sometimes have parent meetups with but can be shy at first and then warm up 30-40 mins and after having a snack. \n\nI know moving from daycare to kindergarten will be a huge transition as it's a different city/building and whole new friends/teacher relationships that she will establish. The school offers a one our drop in for parents and kids to play after the school day that we are thin"

For the past 2 years, I\u2019ll suddenly experience what I can only describe as a panic attack while I\u2019m flying. \n\nI am not scared of flying. This has never happened to me before. I began to feel dizzy, my heart accelerated and I became extremely hot. I felt claustrophobic, like I needed to get out of the plane. It came on suddenly. The feeling slightly improved standing in the aisle but it never went away. A few minutes later the pilot made an announcement that the plane had been holding and circling because we couldn\u2019t get to our destination due to bad weather (there was no bad weather where the plane was at the moment so it had been a fairly smooth ride)\n\nWhen I got off the plane, and breathed in fresh air) I immediately felt better. A few days later I tested positive for COVID after my travel partner began to experience symptoms. So I thought maybe I had gotten a fever on the plane and didn\u2019t know it. \n\nBut then months later, it happened to me on a plane again. And again, no turbulence, no bad weather. Suddenly at some point in the flight, it happened. And then again.\n\nThe 4th time, the plane had not even taken off, people were boarding (it was a big plane) and I suddenly felt dizzy and hot and very claustrophobic.\n\nIt\u2019s now happened to me \u2014 the sudden rush of dizzynsss, suddenly super hot, claustrophobic feeling like I\u2019m being stifled \u2014 few times in my car. Briefly in my room and in a hotel room (but this one is solved by getting up and just walking around for a bit and making the air cooler) And even at a busy restaurant where there was loud music. (I went to the bathroom a ton just to get fresh air and move to distract myself)\n\nI\u2019ve noticed in some of the situations my feet and sometimes my legs feel a bit odd, kind of like the pin and needles falling asleep feeling. Sometimes that starts before the rest of the symptoms. (And yes I do try and do foot exercises and leg exercises in the plane and when I\u2019m sitting for a long time to try and keep them from falling asleep)\n\nAre these just signs of panic or anxiety attacks? I just don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re happening. I\u2019m perfectly fine and then feel ill. I\u2019m wondering if it might be some type of medical condition. But it happens so out of the blue and rarely it makes me doubt.

It feels like all my stomach muscles are contracted constantly when standing.  Like someone is pulling all my abdomen and chest muscles down.

I am on low dose beta blockers and sertraline and doing therapy as well for the past two months.  Had panic attacks in my life before (6 years ago) these attacks do not seem anything like those ones I had back then.  \n\nFeels like maybe bloating issue (but i have bloating which just expands my stomach usually and that\u2019s it!), maybe a spasm of some muscle in there, or anxiety again.  \n\nAppreciate if anyone who ever had something like this lets me know! \n\n\n"

FYI I'm still hard to talk but better, ear is better, and mental confusion seems to come down a little bit.\n\nThis reminds me 3 things:\n\n1. Last time I took Amoxicillin was 2024/11/2 because of sinus infection (probably caused by Depakote because of misdiagnosis as bipolar), 500mg x 4 per day. But at that time I was also taking Xyzal and Tylenol. My anxiety flared up so bad that I needed to take Ativan to control it, and my body temperature was constantly high but not enough to call it a fever. Later I took the evil Augmentin 1g for only 3 pills and I felt I'm dying, took the damn antibiotics out then I still felt bad but not that much, days after I was in a panic and been put back to Prozac (which probably not suitable for me bc it makes me easily to catch a cold), and changed back to Zoloft since 2024/12/4.\n2. Back in my days of studying in master degrees, especially 2022\\~2023, every time I took amoxicillin for flu or cold (yeah the old ENTs really like to give antibiotics for no reason), my symptoms would become worse, but I was taking Zoloft and Xanax then so the anxiety wasn't that bad (also because I was away from home so my parents won't nagging at me lol).\n3. When I was a kid, I sometimes took a green and white capsule from my mom which her called \"anti-inflammatory\" if I had a headache or something, later did I found that it's cephalexin and known to cause anxiety and depression. I was attempted to suicide before university entrance examination because at that time I took a lot of it to combat a \"drug-induced pain\".\n\nI'm taking Zoloft, Concerta and some Librium to control my anxiety, depression and narcolepsy, finally after 26 years of my life, I find out every time I take antibiotics, my mind will fucked up, and antihistamines can strangely control my anxiety sometimes, especailly if I'm having swollen shoulders. Maybe I'm always allergy to antibiotics but I don't know, and yeah SSRIs were actually developed from antihistamine so...what a strange reaction.\n\nEdit: Sorry I'm sensitive now but why the down vote? I'm not trying to against antibiotics but just asking for help or someone has similar reaction like this, and how to deal with it."

    "content": "I was given the opportunity to work for an insurance agency by the owner/agent of the building. ~6 months ago I met her at my current job and asked about what she does and asked about job opportunities. She apparently loved me so much that she went back to her office and told everyone about me. During my interview, the few staff knew vaguely who I was based on her talking about me. About a week ago I was at my wits end at my current job. Too much on my shoulders, low staffing, cut hours. I couldn\u2019t do it. I reached out to her over email and added my resume, reintroduced myself, and hoped for the best. Long story short I got an email back. She replied offering me an interview and the rest is history. I\u2019m now part of their team. The only thing stopping me from joining is a license I have to complete (paid for by the owner) the staff are so friendly. \n\nThe hours are 9-5 Mon-Fri. There\u2019s an hour lunch from 12-1 every day. They have rescue cats and a dog who roams around. There\u2019s a freaking shower inside the building for employees if they want to workout. Basically- this place is nice. It\u2019s not just nice, it\u2019s dreamy compared to any job I\u2019ve had. But I\u2019m absolutely terrified. \n\nMy therapist said if she could\u2019ve chosen any job for me in the world it would be this. She was so excited to hear about the dog and cats as well, she knows I absolutely love dogs. She joked about my manifesting a perfect job from searching for so long. My family has all told me they\u2019re so proud. Even my brother which shocked me because we hardly talk. I feel like I need to take up this job but all I want to do is cry. Every time I try to open the exam practice I just can\u2019t seem to get it pulled up properly. I\u2019m so overwhelmed by the idea of changing to a new place. I\u2019m drowning in worries. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s terrible. What if I don\u2019t make it. What if I can\u2019t do it. What if I cry my first day. What if?\u201d I slammed my laptop shut in frustration after trying to get this course started. I have not been able to enjoy my life at all since this started. I am so drained. So depressed. I want to curl into a ball and die. I can\u2019t sleep. My appetite is gone. My heart\u2019s always racing. I just want this to stop. I want to scream. I want to scream so loud. I want to give up on everything. I\u2019m not ready to move on but I\u2019m never going to become anything in life if I don\u2019t move jobs. I\u2019ll never get a new apartment. I\u2019ll never be able to get a dog. I\u2019ll never be able to buy the things I want. And I don\u2019t even care. I\u2019d rather suffer a shitty life than go through this stress of finding comfort in an entirely new place. Nothing is making me feel better. I just sit and waste time. Comparing the time I spend sitting to how long I\u2019d be in the office for. Losing my mind over never having worked a 9-5. I\u2019m used to 3am shifts. Early in early out. Why does a golden opportunity make me want to give up on living? "

I was told before by a therapist that I was too much for them to handle/help, and it made me feel like shit. I really, really don\u2019t want to go through that again. That would crush me.\n\nI do feel like I need medication to handle day to day life. But do I talk to a psychiatrist first, or talk to a therapist first and ask them if they feel I need a psychiatrist? \n\nWhen or if I talk to a psychiatrist, how do I express that I feel I need stronger medication without sounding like I\u2019m drug seeking? I\u2019ve been on several antidepressants, and they don\u2019t do much if anything at all for my anxiety I feel every single day.\n\nDo I just tell them what I\u2019ve been told I have (as far as mental health conditions) before? Or do I just tell them what\u2019s going on currently with my mental health? I don\u2019t know what I should or shouldn\u2019t tell them.\n\n(For background, I\u2019m 22 but still live at home.)\n\nAlso with therapists, what kind of things do they not keep confidential? I don\u2019t want people coming to my house if I talk about certain things. It terrifies me, so I feel like I need to lie to them and omit things that are really stressing me out or upsetting me. Can they force me to get admitted? Will they keep things like self harm and suicidal thoughts between us? Or would it somehow get to people living with me?\n\nI really do feel like I need help. But I struggle with keeping motivation to attend appointments. Sometimes I feel like it\u2019s a lost cause, I\u2019m always going to be like this. I\u2019ll never know what it feels like to be normal. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me being lazy or if it\u2019s something to do with depression. I want to feel better.

But with my anxiety through the roof, it\u2019s impossible for me to decide, so I\u2019m here hoping for some feedback from anyone who\u2019s been in a similar situation.\n\nHere\u2019s my background: I\u2019ve been on Paxil 25mg for almost two months. The first two weeks were horrible, but then it got somewhat better. I was still super anxious, though, so my doctor added Wellbutrin 150mg, which I\u2019ve been taking for two weeks now.\n\nSince starting Wellbutrin, I\u2019ve felt horrible again\u2014almost like I did before starting Paxil. My symptoms include:\n\t\u2022\tSevere brain fog (I literally couldn\u2019t see shit)\n\t\u2022\tForgetting everything\n\t\u2022\tComplete indecision (I can\u2019t even decide what to eat, let alone bigger choices)\n\nI told my doctor, and he advised me to stop Wellbutrin. But when I mentioned how Paxil was rough in the beginning and got better with time, I said I wanted to give Wellbutrin more time, especially because I\u2019ve read great things about it.\n\nHe explained that it\u2019s very rare and unusual for an antidepressant to make you feel worse before it makes you feel better. He said Wellbutrin is supposed to complement Paxil, not undo its benefits. Still, I keep reading online (and hearing from my therapist) that it can get worse before it gets better, which makes me hesitant to stop.\n\nMy doctor suggested switching to Zoloft instead, but he\u2019s leaving the decision up to me. I\u2019ve read mixed reviews about Paxil + Wellbutrin and Paxil + Zoloft combos\u2014some people love them, others don\u2019t.\n\nNow I\u2019m completely lost and spiraling with anxiety. I don\u2019t want to make the wrong choice. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Did you stick with Wellbutrin despite feeling bad at first, or did you move on to something else?

Didn\u2019t finish it because I ended up in the psych ward and they threw it away.\n\n-December 13th, back at urgent care for reoccurring symptoms, cough I can\u2019t shake, feeling incredibly out of it and dizzy, headache, tight chest.

This is something that has always come and gone throughout those 4 years but nocturnal anxiety is a new thing for me, and like I say it was all kicked off from a nocturnal panic attack one night. \n\nSo for the last few months I fed into it, I didn\u2019t sleep and created bad habits for myself around nighttime. My first port of call was to fix my sleep schedule and try to get more consistent sleep, sleeping and waking up at the same time ext. This is because I know how much poor sleep can negatively affect anxiety. So I started today by implementing things that would promote good sleep. For example, less caffeine, exercising at a good time and not right before bed, walking outside getting early sunlight, not eating too late and meditating before bed. I also made sure to set an alarm to ensure I wake up at the same time everyday and I did try to go to bed a little earlier. \n\nAnd well so far so good, but not perfect. I fell asleep earlier than usual at around 12am but inevitably I woke up at around 1:30am in a slightly anxious state but far from panic, I\u2019m writing this at 2:15am. Again getting the usual symptoms, however instead of trying to calm myself or ignore the symptoms, I actually laid in bed and invited them on to get worse, as if I wanted it to happen. I saw someone else do this and they say it worked tremendously. And it did help for sure, it definitely didn\u2019t remove my physical anxiety symptoms but it did remove the fear surrounding them. \n\nSo as I lay here writing this post I feel pretty okay. It\u2019s unlikely I will be able to fall back to sleep quick but I will probably try to watch something on tv until I eventually feel relaxed enough to fall back to sleep. But this is an improvement even from yesterday when I went to sleep at 4am, the fact I even managed t get to sleep by 12am surprised me, despite the fact I woke up. \n\nHas anyone else got experience with nocturnal anxiety and how did u deal with it ? Does it get better? "

I feel anxiety literally always to one degree or another. I can't remember the last time I was just relaxed. I recently saw a neurologist. I told her about my symptoms: perpetual anxiety, poor sleep, irritability, panic attacks, inability to sit still. The doctor said it's nothing serious and my nervous system is just overloaded. She gave me a prescription for pills, which I bought the same day. It's been a week now, I've been taking the medication steadily. In part, I have actually gotten better. At least I stopped waking up in the middle of the night and feeling very anxious during the day. But my symptoms haven't completely gone away, and the more I think about it, the worse I feel.\n\nI suffer from cardiophobia, and every chest pain or high heart rate feels like the end of everything. It makes it hard for me to fall asleep. When I hear my heartbeat lying on my side it makes me anxious. I've had a hard time getting out of the habit of constantly checking my pulse and blood pressure. But I still feel like something is wrong with my heart, especially when it feels like it's fluttering in my chest. I did an EKG and it showed some abnormalities that were normal like the doctor said. I'm going to see the cardiologist again in a few days because I can't shake the feeling that the previous doctor might have missed something.\n\nMy cardiophobia started after one of my panic attacks a few months ago. Lately, I often feel like I'm dying. Even now as I write this I feel like something bad is about to happen. It scares me insanely. I literally can't just sit/lay still. I'm constantly swinging my leg, twitching on purpose, tossing and turning. If I don't, my anxiety increases dramatically. I always wake up early in the morning. It's not a slow lazy wake up. I wake up quickly, check the time, and start to feel like something bad is about to happen. I miss so much the times when I fell asleep quickly, slept long and uninterrupted and woke up rested. \n\nI'm just so tired of feeling all of that. I can't enjoy life because even when I feel good in my head I just randomly have the thought \"what if I die now\".

I'm an atheist, and I think being dead is the state of nothingness, such as being asleep or before the time I was born. However, the issue is that both being asleep and the time before I was born came to an end due to me waking up/being born, and being dead does not have an end. This led to a panic attack until I fell asleep.\n\nSince then, I have had recurring intrusive thoughts revolving around three themes that cause anxiety:\n\n1. I don't know what it feels like to be dead\n2. My life is great, I want to die on my own terms and not due to some accident/disease\n3. I love my family and assuming the above doesn't happen, I'll be devastated when my parents pass\n\nFor the most part, the anxiety I feel is just doom and stress. However, lately it has been causing me to wake up earlier than normal, I feel a pit in my stomach, and my legs feel tense/tingly. When my mind is preoccupied with something else, I feel completely fine until one of the three thoughts pops up in my head, completely ruining my day. It's like \"Wow, I feel great! It's because I'm not thinking about...\". Even just thinking about this anxiety makes it worse. Furthermore, previously whenever my mind was idle, I would daydream about neutral things such as my hobbies or memories. Now, my mind is just occupied by these three thoughts and I can't daydream about anything else.\n\nIs there a path out of this, whether its stopping these thoughts from forming, or preventing these thoughts from causing anxiety and gloom?"

    "title": "I used Propranolol for the first time last night and it was interesting ...",
    "content": "A few weeks ago I realized that the majority of my anxiety begins with the physical feelings of it, and this spirals into more mental anxiety. I discovered Propranolol on this forum and decided to ask my doctor about it. After listening to what I've experienced and checking my heart rate / blood pressure, she determined I would be a good candidate, and she prescribed me 20mg tablets to use as needed. I took the first one yesterday at 4:30pm, and only took 10mg to just see how it felt. It honestly was great, and I noticed that upon thinking an anxious thought, my heart wouldn't get a sinking feeling like it normally does. Rather I didn't physically react at all, and just simply shrugged at the thought and let it pass. So it seems to have worked even at a smaller dosage, and I hope to continue to use it as needed, I truly think this can be a turning point with my anxiety / OCD and feel positive. \n\n  \nHowever, I did want to hear other people's experiences with side affects. I'd say about 4-5 hours after taking it my stomach was upset. I know this can be a side affect, but it is also possible I just ate something weird since I did go out for lunch earlier in the day. In doing my research about Propranolol, I did see some people share their bad experiences (heart rate dropping way too low in their sleep, hallucinations etc) so because of this I had trouble falling asleep since I was worrying this would happen to me. What was weird is around 1am when I was trying to sleep, I kept smelling camp fire smoke, and it would come and go every few minutes. I don't know if hallucinating smells is a side affect, or if maybe I was just anxious about having a side affect and that is what caused it.  I had a somewhat restless night because of this, but overall I don't think it's much of an issue with the drug, it's moreso me being anxious about taking it for the first time.\n\nAnyways, for the 4-6 hours it was in my system I can say it definelty worked for me, even at a small dosage. I am curious to try it again in a few days to see if I have some of the same issues with my stomach, but I am hoping that it was unrelated. "

I still suffer to this day with dp/dr but not with its full capacity, there are still things I have trouble understanding and I still haven\u2019t been able to help the fogginess.\n\nI will say tho that I have brought myself a long way from when I first started this journey, made excellent improvements and crazy discoveries within my own mind and body. \n\nRecovering isn\u2019t as hard as you might think so don\u2019t panic okay? Doctors might say this is permanent but I promise you it\u2019s not and has never been, this just like any sickness is a temporary condition and will eventually all go away.\n\nNow this does not just go away in one day, it takes time just like anything in this world does so keep patience okay? The first order of business is don\u2019t be scared of dp/dr okay? I know it\u2019s easier said then done but trust me this is the first step to recovery, fear will put that sickness in more control, you have to let it know that you are not scared of it and keep moving forward.\n\nSecond step to recovery is to do things that challenge your fear, by being afraid you will instinctively isolate yourself, challenge your fears, go on walks, talk to friends even if it is scary, go do some activities like working out, cleaning the house, making your bed, reading books stuff like that. The more you get comfortable with this sickness the more it goes away.\n\nThe one issue I ran into was second guessing my own thoughts and emotions, trust me when I say that you do not have to do that because everything you\u2019re feeling is true and it\u2019s you. \n\nI found that watching movies helps a lot just be careful as to not getting to involved with the movie because this sickness will not like that. Be calm, breathe and slowly inch your way into the movie just as you would do for anything else. \n\nDon\u2019t force this to get better, you will have your off days and you will have your good days and those good days will feel amazing trust me they will but don\u2019t be scared when it comes back just except that it\u2019s there understand that your still recovering and continue with your day.\n\nBy doing activities yes you will get to the point where you know deep down you did those things but at the same time you will feel as tho you never did it and that\u2019s completely normal because what that is is it\u2019s your mind thinking your in a life or death situation and it thinks you can\u2019t handle this so it makes you go blank.\n\nI fought this battle and I\u2019ve made amazing progress and I know you can too! Reach out, talk to people who have also experienced this and recovered or are still recovering trust me your not alone, there are more people going through this then you might expect.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to reach out and ask I\u2019m always here, thank you for your time."

As many people have described, and i myself had to deal with, any social interaction, or presentation, etc, i\u2019d get so extremely anxious that i would start shaking, sweating, stuttering, etc. \n\nOntop of my general anxiety, i had an anxiety induced nightmare about a (very specific) white 18 wheeler truck crashing into me and had to work the next day, at the time i was a server at a restaurant so that required me having STEADY non shaky hands. I couldn\u2019t even get to work without having a giant panic attack. On the highway my hands just began to shake, and shake, and shake to the point where it was a full on tremor and unsafe for me to drive so i pulled over and freaked out a bit and was able to make it to work and luckily my manager was like \u201choney, just, take the day off\u201d so i had my family pick me and my car up. \n\nat this point i was so over being chained down by this and needed to do something so i went to see my doctor. i explained, the fact i did NOT like traditional ssri\u2019s or medications similar to those that effect the actual thought process of your brain. I\u2019ve just always had horrible experiences and didn\u2019t wanna test my luck. She prescribed me propranolol and on day 1, unlike ssri\u2019s, it began working. I still had the worries of the truck but my hands wouldn\u2019t shake, it weirdly enough would take all my physical anxiety symptoms, like shaking, sweating, stomach dropping, etc, and put it into my feet. Like my feet would kinda tingle a little. But then i was able to just keep pushing along. When i got to work i felt totally fine, able to serve people with 0% shaky hands. Eventually due to the \u201csafety\u201d that the medication made me feel, i was able to drive happily and freely again and began to lose the memory of that horrible nightmare. \n\nOn a daily bases, it feels like a safety blanket i\u2019m able to easily throw on. Even better is you can take it daily or as needed. Like i said, it only affects your body reactions from anxiety, so i do still have the occasional worry here and there about, well nothing but everything lol.

I read some research studies and reviews on Reddit, which led me to understand that 600 mg of CBD isolate is considered the best dose for anxiety.\n\nI purchased an oil that contains 200 mg per 1 ml. I started with a dosage of 100 mg and waited an hour to feel its effects, as I previously had experience with 20 mg gummies, which didn't have any effect on me. Ultimately, I ended up taking 600 mg a day. I followed this routine for two days.\n\nI experienced intense suicidal thoughts and considered calling a support line. It felt overwhelming and scary, and I couldn't get rid of them. After about five hours, those feelings became milder and eventually faded away.\n\nI couldn't find information about such side effects, but if you're experiencing similar symptoms, give your body a few hours to process them and remember that you're not alone."

I had one years ago which was probably around 20ish minutes but I didn\u2019t have breathing or heart rate problems then, I do now.\n\nI have a condition where the inside of my nose was severely damaged by a surgeon by laser, and I cannot sense my breathing anymore, so I always feel like I am suffocating due to the lack of sensation and dryness, even though my nose is not blocked. Because the receptors in my nose are damaged, my nose cannot \u2018communicate\u2019 to my brain that I\u2019m breathing, which results in a constant \u2018fight or flight\u2019 feeling. I also have anxiety generally and several chronic health conditions meaning i\u2019m in pain all the time and POTS, but the anxiety over not being able to breathe my way through the scan is making me feel like I\u2019ll throw up it is so intense. \n\nAt home I have my nose covered over a lot to block some air (i have a loss of turbinate tissue so my nose is \u2018too open\u2019 and air rushes to my throat- hard to explain unless you have turbinate damage) and I have to keep the room humidified all the time or I get terrible pain in my nose, sinuses and throat. Cold air is also unbearable to me now and feels like brain freeze in my face. At the hospital I will of course have no control over any of these things. \n\nI am severely anxious about this scan. I will take a diazepam but I\u2019m fairly sure last time I took one years ago it didn\u2019t do a lot for me. I didn\u2019t really have time to prepare as I was offered a cancellation so it\u2019s all a bit last minute. I\u2019m so scared of how I will remain still in such a small tube. I also thought I was having a scan that would be a max of 30 minutes and I\u2019ve now been told it\u2019ll be an hour, and this is what has made me completely lose it with anxiety. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips to help me get through this? I\u2019m honestly petrified :( "

For the most part we communicate really well. But sometimes it breaks down and we have some sort of argument & then she gets quiet because she\u2019s upset.\n\nI understand she\u2019s probably not in the talking mood when we just had that argument. But when I feel her pull back like that it really starts to eat me on the inside & I start to over analyze every small interaction we have, and then my mind immediately jumps to \u201cshe\u2019s going to breakup with me\u201d or \u201cshe cheated on me, she\u2019s talking to someone else\u201d. It becomes difficult for me to sleep & focus on my work. I work in tech so I feel pressure to perform there, and maintaining that high performance is hard when anxiety is eating me up.\n\nI\u2019d like to take better control over my anxiety and in those moments of silence learn to be okay, and somehow trust myself that no matter what happens, even if I found out she cheated or something, that I\u2019ll be okay, and I\u2019ll be strong, and move forward. After being cheated on & seeing it between my parents, that seems like the best way forward for my inner-peace, so I can also not put so much pressure from my anxiety on my partner.\n\nAny thoughts on this? I\u2019ve been in and out of therapy for several years, it\u2019s gotten better but still I feel I have a lot of work to do."

    "title": "THC has given me anxiety every night. Please help!",
    "content": "I\u2019m 20 years old and I started smoking weed  (mostly THC) in December 2021. Every day since then I\u2019ve practically smoked at least my THC pen or pot, and it was never really a problem. I noticed after a while I started to get social anxiety after I smoked and preferred to be alone and work out or listen to music. I loved weed so much until after I went on a three month trip overseas. While I was overseas, there was absolutely no access to any marijuana or THC which I didn\u2019t mind because I wanted to take a tolerance break anyways. I had so much fun on my trip and just returned a few days before Thanksgiving (2024). Please note that I became a pretty avid caffeine drinker while I was overseas and brought the habit back when I returned to America. Upon coming home, I decided to buy another THC pen and got high almost every day until the Wednesday before Christmas. That I had a lot of caffeine, and hit my pen multiple times throughout the day. That night before I went to bed, I had decided to take two good hits of my Looper disposable. (I had used so many Looper disposables in the past so I trusted the brand). Guys. When I tell you, this was the most terrifying night of my life. I kid you not. I was up for seven hours pacing around my room in the bathroom feeling like I was having a heart attack and it felt like my neck was getting stabbed every few minutes. My body was shaking, and I was profusely sweating. I legitimately thought I got a laced pen (even though I was hitting it the previous days and felt fine). I ended up staying up all night and the day after I ate a Hardy meal and drink some water and ultimately after that night I did feel better. It doesn\u2019t end there though.\nI decided to throw away that looper pen and get another, which seemed to not have as extreme effects, but I noticed that my throat would always feel constricted and I would get this weird sensation in my head every few minutes that was very uncomfortable. As a THC fein, I was determined to keep smoking at least a little bit every day because it would help me during my gym sessions and as a musician I felt like it made music sound 100% better. Fast-forward to this previous Thursday Night, January 16, I hit my pen around 9:30pm before going to bed and felt completely fine and ended up going to sleep. Maybe around three in the morning I woke up to a horrifying sensation in my brain and my body was shaking. It felt like my body was going through \u201cwaves\u201d of the beginning of a heart attack. I was unable to go to sleep that night but in the morning, I honestly felt fine. Here\u2019s the thing: I am STILL unable to get a full nights sleep without waking up to this feeling, and it only comes at night when I\u2019m trying to get rest. So here\u2019s my question. Are there anyone else who has ever felt this way and is this something that can be undone?? And what is causing this? Was it the copious amount of caffeine over the weeks mixed with my indulgence with THC? Honestly, at this point, I\u2019ve pretty much accepted that I can\u2019t smoke THC or weed again but it seems like this anxiety at night will NOT go away. it\u2019s been four nights now I\u2019m genuinely upset that after all these years of using THC to feel good it has turned on me and made my body feel like it\u2019s essentially shutting down. I would really like to hear feedback on the situation and see if anyone else has similar experiences because this is a bizarre feeling. Almost feels like it\u2019s never gonna end."

I took my Pristiq around 3/3:30PM, but I usually take it around 9AM every day for work. \n\nAbout 30 mins later- I started feeling the worst anxiety and paranoia I\u2019ve ever felt that went on for hours. Before going on pristiq- I struggled with bad anxiety but never anxiety or panic attacks. Since I\u2019ve never really experienced a panic attack- my mind immediately convinced myself that I was \u201coverdosing\u201d on my adderal that I take pretty consistently. My face was numb, non stop shaking, heart racing, chest pain, and sharp anxiety pains that would come and go (which I believe now were \u201cbrain zaps\u201d). \n\nThis went on for HOURS and around 10:30 PM after trying everything from cold and hot showers, breathing exercises, walking around and sitting, trying to distract myself, eating, taking hydroxyzine and melatonin; I eventually decided to call myself an uber to the ER because my delusional mind had convinced I was overdosing and having a heart attack. \n\nAfter the nurse confirmed my vitals were all OK (other than blood pressure & heart rate obviously) & my EKG came back normal- it was almost instantly that I began to calm down. Just mentally knowing my EKG was normal and that I wasn\u2019t going to have a heart attack or seizure, I guess is all I needed to calm down. \n\nCan taking Pristiq only a few hours later than normal cause all of this? I\u2019ve never struggled with panic attacks, and I was under the assumption that you have to fully miss a dose for the withdrawal symptoms of Pristiq to occur. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I know Pristiq can cause brain zaps, which I\u2019ve never felt before- but I believe the \u201czaps\u201d are what really convinced me I was dying since it is such a unique sensation that I\u2019ve never experienced. It felt like my entire body would twitch and a wave of sharp panic would rush through my body for only a second. So extremely terrifying. \n\nI still have some lingering anxiety even a few days later and after I\u2019ve returned to taking my pristiq at my normal time. \n\nJust wondering if this has happened to anyone else? I\u2019m honestly embarrassed about the entire encounter and honestly confused as to why this happened to me. "

    "content": "Hi, so this is my first post on here after finding a few others that I could relate to in some ways, but not fully. This is really to see if anyone else deals with what I do in terms of an anxiety response - this has been an issue for me the past 4 years. It's a niche issue which no one else fully understands, and that leaves me feeling quite isolated - there's comfort in community, so I guess I just wanted to reach out and see if anyone can relate or has experienced something similar.\n\nAlthough this has been a major issue for me for the last 4 years, it actually started around 11 years ago. I was about 18/19 and I can't remember the exact moment, but my stomach made an awkward noise at one point, and I became really self conscious about it. When I say noise I don't mean like a stomach rumble, I mean like a stomach fart, it's the only way I can describe it, and I kinda feel it happening in my rectum rather than main stomach area, but I'm not releasing gas. It actually took me a long time to realise that the noise would happen specifically because I would hold in gas (if I was in a situation I could not release it in), and after several attempts to release, it moves back up to my stomach and triggers the noise which kinda sounds like a fart anyway - I saw someone on a separate thread describe it as 'all the embarrassment, none of the relief' which is spot on \ud83d\ude02\n\nI then would worry about it happening in certain situations, like hanging out with friends, or in a lecture; I had to leave the room one time because I was so worried it would happen. However, this was at a pretty low level, and as soon as I was out of the situation, I wouldn't think about it. This went on for several years (about 8) - I would worry about it and I would get really nervous in certain situations, but then as soon as I was out of the situation, I wouldn't think about it until the next time.\n\nWhen I was 26/27 I started a new job in an office, it was a completely different environment to anywhere I'd worked before (my previous job we had the radio on, I had 3 breaks a day, it was quite chatty and casual and you could work on different reception desks). In the new office, save for phone calls, it was so silent you could hear a pin drop and there was only a small group of us working in the office. This was my worst nightmare because of my issue and I just went into complete meltdown mode. Every day I had to go into the office, I would wake up feeling sick, start wretching so violently I would almost throw up, would wretch all the way to work on the tube, the street, and when I got to work I would have diarrhoea all day, I couldn't eat, I ended up losing about half a stone there over a couple of months. It was hell. My body was trying to tell me to get the hell out of there. I ended up deciding to leave because I couldn't cope anymore, but amazingly giving my mind that release, my symptoms actually stopped, and I was able to stay there. However, I didn't deal with the root of the problem, and a few months later this started showing up in the other areas of my life. I started having anxiety attacks in certain situations which basically just consisted of me getting awful diarrhoea and feeling really nauseous. These situations consisted of the theatre, comedy club, hairdressers, eyelash appointments - and worst of all, I would get it every time I got called into the managers office for a chat (which was very regularly). I realised the trigger is anywhere I can't easily leave (or it would be awkward/embarrassing to leave) and for it to be quiet enough to hear a stomach noise. It was hell and I'm still struggling with it 4 years later.\n\nI ended up doing hypnotherapy which was amazing - it managed to stop these reactions and I felt incredible for the first time in a long time. I still had the fear about the stomach noises though, but I'm not sure I'll ever be rid of that. However, around 7/8 months after doing hypnotherapy, I got triggered by a life event and all my symptoms came back ten fold. I had a new job at that point which I loved, but it got so bad to the point I was going to the toilet over 10 times in a couple of hours because my stomach issues just wouldn't stop and just being in the office became a trigger again. I had to have time off work. My hypnotherapist wasn't really helpful the second time round - he helped a bit, but he didn't have a lot of answers and it wasn't quite working in the same way as before. He ended up saying that we 'failed' and he couldn't do anymore to help me - we had to stop having sessions. I've since done CBT, EMDR, and none of it's worked. I'm now seeing another hypnotherapist, but I hate to say I feel a little skeptical.\n\nAs of now, I'm struggling with diarrhoea every time I have a work meeting, and in other areas like beauty appointments and the theatre which I love going to \ud83d\ude22 it's basically become a conditioned fear response in my body and because of past experiences, my mind recognises certain situations as (incorrectly) dangerous, and is triggering my flight response to get out of there to safety. It's really evolved from the fear of stomach noises and now it's so difficult to live my life when I get scared and uncomfortable in so many normal every day situations. However, the fear of stomach noises is still there even if I don't get the diarrhoea, as that was the original fear which I think to some extent I can never be fully rid of. Being in a work meeting or an appointment with your eyes taped shut and having to hold in explosive diarrhoea is awful!! I've also struggled on dates, when I sleep next to someone new I can't sleep the entire night because my body won't let me and I'm worried I might make a noise. I've had anxiety attacks when staying over at someone's before and I've had to leave a date early because I got surprised with a comedy club on the date and got super uncomfortable and had to get out of there \ud83d\ude43\n\nHas anyone had anything similar? I would be grateful to know if any therapy I haven't tried has been helpful for this kind of issue, as I really don't know what to do anymore. Sorry for the super long post - not sure anyone will be arsed to read this, But it was pretty cathartic to write \ud83d\ude02"

    "title": "Generalized Anxiety and 4th Day on Lexapro",
    "content": "TW: health anxiety and hypochondria, panic attacks\n\nI am in my 30s, and overall have been pretty anxiety free. When I was a kid, I would always be afraid of people dying, me dying, people leaving and not coming back, etc. This fear has come and went throughout most my life, resulting in pretty significant distress and maybe a mini panic attack every couple years. I do remember several times around the age of 10-14 where I would go outside because I felt like I couldn't breathe and would check to see if my fingernails were turning blue. Now that I am typing this out, I suppose I have never been anxiety free lol. Wow.\n\nAnyway, at 28 I had a full blown panic attack when I found out I had fatty liver disease. This heightened state of anxiety lasted two days and my face had this crazy tingling sensation on one side that eventually convinced me to go to the ER, thinking I was having a stroke or something. Of course, everything was fine. Ever since that big panic attack I have been dealing with almost daily anxiety. Occasionally I would go weeks or months feeling pretty good. Other times, I would spend days feeling like I was on the brink of a panic attack.\n\nA month ago, I had another panic attack after seeing a patient with mouth cancer. Due to ear and mouth pain I had been having, I was convinced I had mouth cancer. I was puking, crying, having diarrhea. My face began to tingle again, I felt disease, short of breath, and like my throat was closing. I left work to go to a walk in to get it checked out and the issue was that I had fluid behind my ear. Over the next 4 weeks I continued to go in and out of crying and panicking fits thinking there was something wrong. The tingling on my face persisted, and by that time I was convinced I had MS or a brain tumor or aneurysm. I was afraid to go to sleep or walk alone thinking I could collapse at any second.\n\nAfter my first panic attack I went to a place that taught about meditation and really got into it. It was the only thing that helped in addition to some of the mantras I would repeat to myself. Ever since these have helped me, but they only bring me temporary relief in the moment. I knew I could no longer live like this.\n\nI scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist and she was really great. I couldn't have been luckier. I was started on lexapro and have been taking it for 4 days. I know most say it can take weeks to feel a difference, but I swear by the 2nd day I have noticed a change. One of the biggest being my mind is not CONSTANTLY active. I don't think of or plan conversations before they happen. I am not thinking of my future 4 decades in advance. I do not think of and fear and cry about me or my wife getting old and dying. My face hasn't tingled or felt like it is having microspasms for the past few days. The pressure in my forehead is gone. I haven't felt sick to my stomach (except today because I drank coffee- anytime my stomach feels bad I feel anxious, and vice versa). My breathing feels clearer, not really sure what that's about & maybe it's a placebo thing...or just the relief I feel in my body? I have had issues with brain fog but I also have sleep apnea and use CPAP but when my nose is really stuffed up I can't use it so I am not sure if that has improved yet or if it is related to anxiety or not so the verdict is still out on that one. Yesterday, I felt my brain fog was \"deeper\" in my mind, more central, rather than in my forehead if that makes sense, and then it lifted a few hours after I took my lexapro, but it could be that it dissipated once I got enough blood and oxygen flowing up there because I didnt use my cpap the night before lol.\n\nI want to say that I am a very skeptical person and that after some bad experiences with psychedelics I was terrified of medication because I was terrified of having that feeling like I wasn't myself. After only 4 days I will say that I am upset that I didn't do this sooner. My mind feels relatively clear. I am living in the present. I feel more focused. I feel less fidgety. I actually don't think I've been shaking my legs for days now, and I don't feel like I'm going to explode if I'm not shaking them. My jaw isn't clenched. The only thing that I notice is that now that my mind isn't constantly active, I sometimes find myself just kind of staring into the imaginary abyss, not thinking, just sitting..but not worrying, or planning, or catastrophically thinking, or feeling a pain in my body thinking it's some disease. It's not a bad thing, just different. Now that my mind isn't so busy, I think I will finally have the mental capacity to do all the things I'd want to do but never start. I have even felt like leaving the house the past 2 days! I don't worry as much about my wife getting in a wreck or shot or anything like that. I think I may have ADHD as well, but I want to give this a couple months before I do anything else in terms of medication. Anyway, if you have any questions about lexapro or my experience just comment!"

    "content": "\nFirst off, I know I'm probably gonna get lots of hate and criticism for this post, since this is reddit. Also, all of this is probably made worse right now by me PMSing real bad.\n\nI spent years feeling sad and worthless because no matter how I tried, no one wanted me romantically. No one ever asked me out, had a crush on me, or showed any interest in me, except for ONE guy back when we were teens. I tried online dating. It was always \"I'm sorry, but this isn't going to work out, we don't have the right chemistry, youre not my type, I'm not physically attracted to you...\" etc etc. Either that or they'd block me as soon as they saw pics of me. If I got a crush on someone, thet never liked me back. The one time I was brave enough to shoot my shot, I ended up getting rejected with all the reasons why I wasn't right for him. I know it's probably partly because I'm not attractive at all.\n\nBack in October, I made an online friend. We'll call him L. L and I got along super well, and in November we both admitted we really liked each other and are now in a LDR.\n\nThe first month or so was amazing. We were both so happy. He was SO sweet to me, always telling me such sweet and adorable things. He made me feel so loved and wanted all the time. He was also super caring. If I was sad or not feeling well (which happens often bc of my chronic illness) he would tell me how sad it made him, how he wished he were here to look after me and comfort me, tell me what he'd do if he were here to take care of me, etc. \n\nHe would tell me the sweetest things all the time like \"Sometimes I wonder if you're just a dream I will wake up from because I just can't believe you are real, you're so perfect, I'm obsessed with you, I wish I could make you see how absolutely beautiful I find you, if my coworkers ask me why I'm so happy I will just tell them I'm talking to this amazing girl...\" \n\nFast forward in January, I still get a little bit of affection, but nothing like the way he was in the first month. He doesn't say things like that anymore. I can tell he doesn't feel as strongly for me anymore. He is not really caring anymore. If I'm sad or ill it's just \"Goodnight, hope you feel better.\" No affection or care or empathy. \n\nI'm convinced he is losing interest in me. The only thing is, I'm not sure if he really is, or if I'm just being overly anxious/OCD/overthinking. From the beginning, I did have a slight fear that he would stop liking me or lose interest in me and now this fear has just gone out of control and taken over everything. This has made me clingy, made me constantly try too hard to make him like me, made me overanalyze everything he says and does. I don't even enjoy the time I spend with him anymore. I'm too stressed and sad. I almost want to break up with him or ghost him because I can't handle this anymore. I want to save my heart before it gets broken.\n\nWay back in the beginning, I told him I was just waiting for the day he tells me he doesn't want me anymore. He responded lovingly and emphatically \"You will be waiting forever!\". Nowadays, occasionally I bring up or hint at the fear that he will lose interest in me. He gives me very matter of fact, affectionless replies like \"Well if I do, that's on me, it's not a you problem\" and \"We can still be friends if that happens\". I couldn't stand to just be friends with him. I've fallen for him too hard \n\nI cry a lot and feel sad because I think he's losing interest in me and I feel worthless, unloved, unwanted, not good enough. I should have known that someone actually wanting me was impossible. \n\nAnother thing that has been tearing me apart is that he's made it clear that he doesn't love me, he only likes me. He wants to wait until he means it to tell me he loves me. But at this point, I don't think he will ever love me. This breaks my heart into pieces, because I love him. I cry about it so much. It tears me apart.\n\nThe last issue here is that earlier this month, he got REALLY mad and we had an argument and actually didn't talk for a day because he found out that a year ago I got taken advantage of. He acted like I had purposely cheated on him and then lied to him about it (didn't tell him till this month). I thought he was going to end it to me. He said he has to sympathy for what happened to me because all I had to do was say no or stop talking to the guy once I knew things weren't right. \n\nYesterday was the straw that broke the camel's back. I read a post by a girl who had also been taken advantage of and was afraid to tell her long distance bf. She finally told him, and his response was SO perfect and so genuinely loving and caring. I could tell he loves and cares for her so much. This is so selfish, but reading about his reaction broke my heart with jealousy and sadness. If my bf really cared and wanted me, that's the way he would have reacted.\n\n I had already been super anxious and sad thinking about my bf losing interest in me. This post broke me and I cried for 5 hours. I still feel messed up this morning. My bf knew I went to bed crying and very sad last night (I blamed PMS). But all he said was \"Whats making you so sad?\" and \"Hope you feel better.\" In the beginning, if I cried, he would tell me how he wished he was here for me, tell me how sad it made him that I was sad, and tell me he wished he could cuddle me until I felt better \n\nI'm just so sad, and the anxiety this relationship is causing me is too much to handle. I was happier when we were just friends. I know that nobody wants me. Nobody loves me romantically and they never will. I'm not good enough, not pretty enough, not special enough, not worthy of love. Please give me advice. \n"

I\u2019ve found it hard to explain my anxiety to him, he feels like there\u2019s something wrong with him and i feel super guilty because it\u2019s not his fault at all. \n\nI just feel like I\u2019ll end up self sabotaging and ruining everything. I don\u2019t want to lose him because I really love him and I want this to work. I guess I\u2019m just looking for advice from people who have been in similar situations. I\u2019m on antidepressants and anxiety meds but sadly can\u2019t afford therapy right now and I feel lost, the meds help but I have no therapist to talk to. "

Despite managing my mental health through meds, therapy, and exercise, my anxiety attacks are triggered by work. I excel at solving problems but keep getting pushed into leadership roles, which I don\u2019t enjoy and trigger more anxiety. Has anyone found a job where they can work alone and earn well without the leadership stress?\n\n\\------------------------------------\n\nHey there! I (40F) have a GAD diagnosis, social anxiety, and a high-masking introvert personality. After several years, I\u2019ve managed to get it all under control through medication, therapy, and exercise. Most aspects of my life are going well, and I\u2019m proud of how far I\u2019ve come. However, every single anxiety attack I experience stems from work.\n\nI love working alone and enjoy solving strategic problems. I\u2019ve worked hard to become a specialist in several areas. But I always end up in leadership roles because, as an overthinker, I tend to come up with unique solutions. People see this as a superpower, so when they notice my ability to find solutions others don\u2019t, they often promote me to lead teams and train others to do what I do.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: I don\u2019t like people, I don\u2019t enjoy training them, and I never wanted to be a people leader. I\u2019ve tried approaching it methodologically, but I just can\u2019t seem to make it work. Additionally, a higher role means more exposure, which leads to stuttering and a foggy brain in front of extroverted colleagues who don\u2019t seem to understand what anxiety feels like.\n\nI\u2019ve changed jobs several times, but I always find myself at the same point: starting strong, getting a team, and eventually entering the \u201cI hate everyone and everything\u201d phase. This increases my anxiety attacks and leaves me counting down the days until retirement.\n\nMy last anxiety attack was especially brutal, and I ended up hurting myself. Has anyone else experienced this? Did you manage to find a job where you work alone and earn decent pay? I\u2019d really appreciate any input. Thanks so much for reading this rant!"

Today, I was in a city and a man entered a shop I was in and started trying to capture everyone\u2019s attention. We all laughed it off. The store had only female employees and female customers.

The last time I travelled alone on a backpacking trip was in 2018, but I spent the first 3 months with a friend, which really helped me feel safe and able to adjust to this new way of living. Afterwards, I travelled solo in Taiwan and the Philippines. \n\nI flew from the UK. I was so, SO excited. I made a rough itinerary for the first 2 weeks, had a loose plan for the remainder. Was going to hire a campervan and explore the countryside, too. \n\nAs soon as I landed and started walking through the steets of Shinjuku to my hostel, I started to feel teary. I was alone. Why am I feeling like this, I thought? You've done this before. I thought I might have a good cry once I arrived there, but it didn't happen. I went to sleep. The next day after a pretty rough night, I woke up excited to explore. By the nighttime, I was pretty exhausted. Might have done too much as I walked 30000 steps. \n\nI didn't sleep well again. Had a lot of fear around the lack of sleep. I think the brutal jet lag (which I never expected and hadn't experienced like this before) and sleep deprivation caused me to feel overly emotional, overwhelmed and always fearing the worst. I am an anxious person generally, but I don't think I have the self-confidence or belief that I can depend on myself alone. Not rely on others for comfort or help. I tried to have a calmer day. I felt quite anxious the entire time. Had no appetite. I really struggled to deal with the stress of finding food that I wanted. I gave up and went back to the hostel.\n\nI'm now sat at the airport waiting to fly home, after calling numerous people and feeling like I couldn't handle being there any longer. Haven't stopped crying the entire time. Feeling quite distraught and disappointed with myself. I was definitely catastrophising everything. I know that if someone was with me, I would have been okay. And most probably, if I'd lasted one or two more days, I'd get over the jet lag and enjoy the rest of my holiday. I was just so overwhelmed and missing the people I care about and fearing that I can't depend on myself in case something goes wrong. \n\nI know Japan will still be there, but I was craving this for so long and needed a break after a stressful work period.

And sure, I know there\u2019s a part of being anxious that people might say is \u201call in your head,\u201d but I think it\u2019s so much more than that. It\u2019s not just in the head\u2014it\u2019s trauma that\u2019s literally trapped in the body. There are experiences in life that caused this.\n\nI can remember moments where I wasn\u2019t as anxious, and I\u2019m working really hard to get back to those moments. But yeah, it\u2019s hard, because sometimes mental health challenges aren\u2019t visible from the outside. It\u2019s easy for others to discredit them or to assume it should be simple to just \u201cstop\u201d the symptoms.\n\nWhen I think about it, though, the parasympathetic nervous system (you know, the system responsible for calming the body) is often in overdrive for years in many cases of anxiety. Switching from that constant state of fight-or-freeze mode to a balanced and calm state isn\u2019t something the body even recognizes as normal. It takes practice, deliberate effort, and a lot of unlearning and undoing negative behavioral patterns before you can start to see certain effects ease up."

Since I study psychology, I knew I needed to start therapy right away and did so (a mix of somatic and trauma-informed methods) and it has worked wonders on the way I process experiences mentally, and I feel really balanced in mind, however, somatic sympthoms like nausea or troubles with sleeping persist and often makes me feel disconnected from my body. So I decided to consult a psychiatrist, who put me on autogenic training and 15mg of Mirtazapine (her reasoning was that the nausea [and thus disordered eating and weight loss, I was underweight to begin with] and disorganised sleep pattern doesn\u2019t allow my vegetative nervous system to regulate itself and regenerate) \n\nMy reasoning to seek out a psychiatrist wasn\u2019t to get medication but for a doctor to see if I have any indications of an underlying medical condition that could perhaps perpetuate my physical symptoms (everything seems to be fine except my vitamin D levels, though I do have my own doubts about my endocrine system for other reasons) but medication is what I\u2019ve got! I\u2019ve been a bit iffy about going on them in general but she\u2019s got a great point about how it could help the eating and sleep disorders, which in turn could alleviate my physical symptoms, so I\u2019ll consult my therapist too and might give it a try.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve wanted to ask is did anyone with similar troubles try this medication, and if so, how was it?

    "content": "I simply don't know what to do so I guess I'll start at the beginning. I'm 46 and have been experiencing sharp chest pains and crippling attacks that feel like I'm having a heart attack. Very sporadic poking in my heart area, tingling up the back of my neck, left arm is fluctuating and pulsating, can't breathe. A trip to the ER and 2 EKGs + blood work show I'm not having a heart attack. 1st EKG Dr said benign repolarization which is basically athletes heart and occurs in 25% of elite athletes. I saw a cardiologist in 2022 for palpitations and aside from a slightly enlarged heart she also found athletes heart. This is different than before, my heart is constantly bounding meaning I can feel it all the time especially when I try to sleep so I'm not sleeping at all maybe 3 hours a night. People in my life think it's panic attacks so my gf is an NP and ordered me Xanax Friday night. Normally Xanax knocks me in my fanny. Heart started Fri night, after 15 minutes Xanax made it stop. Saturday morning another hardcore attack happened but trying to deal with it naturally I put a meditation video on and rocked back and forth. When I came to I was covered in snot and tears with an overwhelming sense of loneliness and abandonment. Another attack last night took half a Xanax .25 mgs but after 20 minutes it didn't help so took another. After 25 minutes they went away but the usual very loopy and groggy feeling I'VE ALWAYS HAD wasn't there. I've never taken that much and I felt normal. We took our dogs out and when I came home hour or so later body was heavy but I was still shocked at how normal I felt. Prior to all this happening I felt like Deniro in Analyze this. Thought panic attacks that felt like heart attacks were impossible, it just didn't compute for me. I also never understood how people took Xanax and felt normal. \n\nThis started 10 days ago and has gotten significantly worse since last Thursday. Growing up in Hell's Kitchen, my close circle of friends in highschool are either dead or in jail. Mid 90s were just different I guess and can't control who you vibe with. I went to the Marines in 2000 and had 2 deployments to Iraq and 1 to Afghanistan. Anyone I was close with was killed or they now live on the other side of the country. I hit the girlfriend lottery, I'm amazed at how lucky I am. She's the most supportive and genuinely good human I've ever been around. I don't need much, her our dogs and my plants I'm the richest lad in the world. Not close with my family since my Mom passed and tbh wasn't very close before that either. When I came home from the Marines I'm a people person but couldn't be around anyone. Id feel uncomfortable on trains after a few stops, couldn't sleep but nothing like this. If there's a sudden loud noise like thunder, fireworks etc the WiFi in my brain shuts off and I'm basically catatonic for a few minutes. Awake and aware but trapped inside my body. It's something I've had to disclose on every first date because that's something a potential partner should know before getting involved. Doesn't happen often but it does happen. If I prepare myself and expect it im fine but who can predict gnarly thunder lol. \n\nSince I came home I've unintentionally pushed people away. I can talk to someone at Lowe's for an hour but any relationships I don't pursue or put effort in if that makes sense. Growing up I switched schools K-9 9x (not exaggerating) so I've always had gift of gab but anyone I get close to gets taken from me so that + the trauma from the Marines developing close relationships has been difficult. I'm seeing a cardiologist the 31st, earliest I can get in but these attacks keep happening. I'm 6'5\" 260 lbs and have been in elite shape my entire life. The last 7 months I've had two major surgeries. Torn meniscus in June and rebuilt my inner and middle ear end of November so I've taken a lot of time off from gym and my body is very very tight. I had just started lifting heavy again when these pains started except I know what those feel like. I do cupping at home, electric stim, massage gun, have a candy cane looking massage thing that is able to get huge knots out but hurts like hell. Haven't seen my acupuncturist in a bit and she thinks I have thoracic other syndrome but the other stuff is anxiety. I was convinced Friday I was having cardiac arrest. The fact that Xanax works within a few minutes and I've felt normal afterwards, maybe I've suppressed things I've tried really hard to forget and it's bursting through my subconscious. \n\nSaw the head navy shrink upon discharging and told him what I've shared. Couldn't sleep, uncomfortable around people, anytime I see a helicopter (long story), the loud noises etc. He writes me a script but it's 120 Oxy 80s. I said \"sir I don't have cancer I just want to feel normal again.\" He replied and I quote, \"you grunts never cease to amaze me. You all walk in here and think you know everything. You want to contribute to the growing epidemic of serviceman that have taken their own life go right ahead but please sign here showing you're refusing treatment please.\" Never forgot that moment. I can still smell the room like it was yesterday. I was stunned and initial reaction was GFYS so I never went back and tried on my own. Nature, the beach, gym and music all seemed to help and I'm a lot luckier than most. Turns out they did this to every one in my unit and I'm assuming others. \n\nI know I need therapy and need to commit to it like I have squats. These attacks are crippling and my EKG and blood show I'm not having heart attacks but they feel so real and they're the scariest thing I've ever experienced. If you've made it this far, thank you. I genuinely don't know what to do because there are people saying crap like \"you get the vaccine?\" which I did but telling me that isn't helping calm me down. I've never felt this scared and hoping this ends yesterday. Feels like something sharp poking my heart, very sporadic and I only feel these pains abd weird feelings on my left side. When I went to hospital it felt like 250 pounds standing on my chest. "

That\u2019s me I\u2019m fine all day, I don\u2019t get anxious and I\u2019m generally happy and relaxed, but night is when it changes. Idk why but I get so freaked out by nighttime and have had several nocturnal panic attacks. \n\nAnd it eats me up because I feel like two face, where I don\u2019t have anxiety for half of a day but for the other half I do. It makes me convince myself not to take meds since my anxiety is limited to nighttime and doesn\u2019t seem consistent enough. But it effects my sleep massively i literally lay in bed like I\u2019m stuck in the ww2 trenches. And I haven\u2019t been able to sleep normal for months I sleep at like 4am, and frequently get anxiety attacks at 1-3am. "

    "title": "Has anyone dealt with random adrenaline surges and somatic panic attacks with no clear trigger?",
    "content": "Background and Development of Symptoms\n\nFrom age 12, I became acutely aware of how others perceived me, which marked the onset of severe anxiety accompanied by somatic symptoms, most notably excessive sweating. Between the ages of 12 and 15, I began experimenting with a variety of substances (curious of exploring the bounds of my conscious experience) including psilocybin, LSD, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and MDMA, while eventually being prescribed medications like SSRIs for anxiety. Zoloft provided moderate relief, but other medications, such as buspirone, exacerbated my condition significantly.\n\nBy 19, I was experiencing severe depression with frequent suicidal ideation (for 6 years), alongside pervasive anxiety. Much of my anxiety manifested as anticipatory fears tied to specific events, social interactions, or intrusive thoughts, and somatic symptoms such as sweating and gastrointestinal distress were a constant presence. Chronic insomnia compounded my issues, leading to a six-year reliance on diphenhydramine (Benadryl) for sleep\u2014a practice I now understand to have detrimental long-term effects.\n\nAt age 19, I was diagnosed with bipolar depression and prescribed Seroquel, which proved moderately effective in improving sleep (via histamine receptor antagonism) and reducing anxiety, especially in conjunction with gabapentin. However, at age 23, I developed a new form of anxiety that differed from my previous experiences. This anxiety was marked by sudden, random surges of panic unconnected to any identifiable trigger. These episodes involved a rush of adrenaline, accompanied by somatic symptoms such as tingling skin, difficulty breathing, and an overwhelming sense of discomfort in existing\u2014a stark contrast to my prior anticipatory anxiety. While my anticipatory anxiety also expanded to fears\u2014driving, choking, flying, traveling, etc.\n\nPost-Seroquel Period and the Emergence of Cognitive Symptoms\n\nAt age 24, I self-titrated off Seroquel and began focusing on supplementation to support my mental and physical health. My regimen included EPA/DHA omega-3s, vitamin D3, magnesium glycinate, and later glycine for sleep. Over the following year, I felt better than ever\u2014my anxiety was significantly reduced, my mood stabilized, and my overall quality of life improved.\n\nHowever, in October 2024 (age 26), I increased my glycine intake from 1 g to 2 g due to heightened stress. Soon after, I began experiencing word retrieval issues and memory difficulties, which I attributed to the higher glycine dose. I discontinued glycine entirely, but this reintroduced the random somatic panic attacks and physical discomfort I had previously experienced.\n\nCurrent Symptoms and Hypothesis\n\nCurrently, I experience:\n\t\u2022\tRandom somatic panic attacks, characterized by sudden adrenaline surges, tingling sensations, and an overwhelming sense of discomfort.\n\t\u2022\tCognitive discomfort, including difficulties with focus, memory, and word retrieval.\n\t\u2022\tHeightened sensitivity to psychoactive substances (e.g., caffeine, sugar, Tylenol), with noticeable shifts in my consciousness after consumption.\n\t\u2022\tIncreased sensitivity to sensory stimuli, such as sounds and sights.\n\nMy hypothesis is as follows:\n\t1.\tGlutamate/GABA Dysregulation:\nYears of stress, medication use, and glycine supplementation disrupted the balance between glutamate (excitatory) and GABA (inhibitory) neurotransmitters. This imbalance has left glutamate overactive and GABA underactive, leading to overstimulation of NMDA receptors. The result is heightened sensitivity, random adrenaline spikes, and somatic anxiety.\n\t2.\tNMDA Receptor Overactivation:\nExcessive glutamate has caused NMDA receptor overactivation, which fuels my panic attacks and cognitive discomfort. This dysfunction also likely underpins my hypersensitivity to external stimuli and substances.\n\t3.\tHPA Axis Dysregulation:\nChronic stress, insomnia, and medication withdrawal have left my HPA axis (stress regulation system) overactive. My body struggles to regulate cortisol and adrenaline, causing random surges of stress hormones that manifest as panic episodes.\n\t\nCurrent Plan and Rationale\n\nI have adopted a supplement regimen to address these root causes:\n\t1.\tNAC (N-Acetylcysteine):\n\t\u2022\tPurpose: Reduces glutamate overactivity, calms NMDA receptor hyperactivity, and boosts glutathione production to mitigate oxidative stress and repair neuronal damage.\n\t\u2022\tGoal: Stabilize the nervous system and reduce random panic attacks.\n\t2.\tTaurine:\n\t\u2022\tPurpose: Enhances natural GABA activity, inhibits NMDA receptor overactivation, and stabilizes calcium signaling in neurons.\n\t\u2022\tGoal: Support neurotransmitter balance, reduce somatic anxiety, and improve sleep.\n\t3.\tOmega-3 EPA/DHA:\n\t\u2022\tPurpose: Reduces neuroinflammation and supports overall brain function and emotional resilience.\n\t\u2022\tGoal: Provide a foundation for long-term nervous system repair.\n\t4.\tMagnesium Threonate:\n\t\u2022\tPurpose: Supports GABA function and modulates NMDA receptor activity, helping to calm the nervous system.\n\t\u2022\tGoal: Enhance relaxation and improve cognitive function.\n\t5.\tVitamin D3/K2:\n\t\u2022\tPurpose: Regulates neurotransmitter activity and supports overall brain health.\n\t\u2022\tGoal: Maintain optimal health and resilience.\n\t6.\tAstaxanthin:\n\t\u2022\tPurpose: Reduces oxidative stress and protects neurons from further damage.\n\t\u2022\tGoal: Enhance antioxidant support alongside NAC.\n\nConclusion\n\nI believe the combination of stress, medications, and glycine dysregulation left my nervous system hypersensitive, with glutamate overactivity, NMDA receptor dysfunction, and HPA axis dysregulation at the core of my symptoms. This has resulted in a state of heightened anxiety and sensitivity, which no previous interventions (e.g., benzodiazepines, SSRIs, or even CBT) have fully addressed.\n\nMy current approach\u2014focused on NAC, taurine, and other supportive supplements\u2014is designed to treat the root causes rather than mask symptoms. While these issues have been debilitating, I remain optimistic that this targeted approach will help restore balance to my nervous system over time.\n\nAt the age of 20, I made the decision to stop all recreational substance use. I never experienced dependency, but I realized I wanted to fight for my life and work toward stability. Since then, I\u2019ve achieved significant progress in managing my depression, finding a level of stability I hadn\u2019t experienced before.\n\nI\u2019ve also taken deliberate steps to optimize my overall well-being, including adopting a whole-food diet and eliminating carcinogens and endocrine disruptors from my environment. This includes using only clean skincare, makeup, and cleaning supplies. However, despite these efforts, I continue to struggle with anxiety\u2014specifically, random bursts of adrenaline that seem to come out of nowhere.\n\nThese episodes are not tied to specific thoughts or events. They involve a sudden, overwhelming surge of physical discomfort: my body feels wiry, tingly, and restless, and my mind feels blank but trapped in a state of pure panic. It\u2019s as though my entire system rebels against existing for no apparent reason.\n\nHas anyone experienced anything similar, and if so, how did you address it?"

    "title": "Wishing I could release anxiety through calmer means",
    "content": "The most effective way for me to calm down through a healthy and calm means is through exercise, which mostly helps me get to a point where I can cry while doing so and then I feel great. But this is kind of hard to do at 2am when people are sleeping and it's dark and cold and not smart for a woman to be walking around at.\n\nBut all the other coping mechanisms just don't quite do the job. The stretching, the meditating, the breathing, the walking up and down the stairs, counting my blessings, ect, hardly work for me.\n\nI just want to let it all out through screaming, crying, punching, stomping, throwing and breaking things. It's so fast and I feel so great afterwards. But again, 2am, people are sleeping. And it's not very healthy in some cases.\n\nI just don't get how people make the healthy releases work. If I'm not ugly crying, I'm not releasing any of my anxieties. And I just wish I could do some Yoga and get back to sleep!\n\n\n\nEdit: I've also tried so many different substances, from chamomile tea, to valerian root, to many other things that are suppose to promote calmness, and sure they can help, but they never fix the anxiety to the point where I can go back to sleep.

    "title": "Does anyone else act \u201ccrazy\u201d during moments of high anxiety?",
    "content": "(22,F) Hello, currently in a state of heightened anxiety and have been for about 5ish hours. I\u2019ve noticed sometimes when I\u2019m having a lot of anxiety, especially over prolonged periods of time, sometimes I\u2019ll act \u201ccrazy\u201d. For example, humming/rocking, hitting myself on the chest, repetitive motions, moving in super slow motion, saying my thoughts out loud to myself/repeating them, widening my eyes, darting my eyes around the room, talking/texting in a weird grammatical patterns or with improper grammar, etc. I have the power to not do these things. For example if my boss were to show up on my doorstep and say we needed to have an urgent meeting immediately, I could pull myself together and act completely normal. But when I\u2019m alone or with my partner I engage in these behaviors (in situations where I\u2019m experiencing a lot of anxiety/before an anxiety attack or after). It sends me down a bit of a spiral, thinking I\u2019m headed towards a nervous breakdown due to my anxiety, feeling weird about engaging in those behaviors even tho I could just stop, or worrying about myself and if I\u2019m okay. But at the same time all of these behaviors are soothing, and help me to move through my anxiety and sometimes detach myself from the situation. Has anyone else experienced something similar? For the record I do understand a lot of these behaviors are stims or ways to self soothe. I do have ADHD, and I\u2019d never find someone crazy for engaging in these behaviors to self soothe, or for other reasons. My thing is, when I do them, it feels like leaning into my anxiety. It doesn\u2019t make me feel stable, or make me feel like I\u2019m doing ok when I engage in these behaviors. Yet I continue to do them when I\u2019m having a lot of anxiety, even tho it can cause me to spiral.  It\u2019s a weird paradox, these behaviors soothe me while also causing me to spiral. It\u2019s hard to explain so I hope I\u2019m doing an alright job, any advice or suggestions or even just comments to say you relate would be appreciated. "

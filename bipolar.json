It feels good, it feels strong, I've done some of my best paintings you know? But it sucks because I'm 25 and I don't really feel like I know myself.\n\nAs the meds are kicking in, the ill part of my mind is going, \"You can't think as fast, the meds are slowing you down, this is bad, the doctor was wrong.\" But in reality, for the first time in my life I can sit an enjoy something simple like sitting in the sun. I was showing symptoms by my teen years, I have had so little time to just exist unhampered by the abuse I faced as a child and my mental health issues. But losing that \"edge\" leaves me feeling scared and intensely vulnerable. However, I've been suicidal since I was 11 and I haven't been suicidal in 4 months, which is incredible for me.\n\nIt's also scary because my mother is also bipolar, but unmedicated, and as her daughter I was given a front row seat to her spectacularly bad decline. She went from a mostly functional but unlikable loner to a raging alcohol-homicidal maniac. I do not speak in hyperbole, she's threatened my father's life more than once and pulled a knife on me. I know the neuroprotective qualities of anti convulsants, but if I'm being real, a part of me fears getting into a relationship because of it. I have a hard enough time keeping friends. It's hard to realized how much this has effected my life up until this point. I believed I was stable, which is crazy. The \"edge\" I had felt good, but it and that cycle was wreaking HAVOC on my life. All of my family is already commenting on how much more functional I am, and it feels good. I guess, in sum, I'm meeting myself for the first time and I'm grateful for the opportunity, but I'm scared and feeling lonely."

I was charismatic as fuck.\n\nThe next couple of days I couldn't quite sleep or eat. But that didn't affect my energy levels much if anything at all. I got bad anxiety and was constantly jittery. Heart rate went up. Felt like I drank 25 cups of coffee in the morning. At this point I kinda realised something wasn't right.\n\nI drove very recklessly without realising it. I'd drift, speed, miss traffic rules, blast music and sing along. I wen't on shopping sprees, reached out to old friends, wanted a tattoo, and stopped caring about my day to day routine. I'd have HORRIBLE anxiety when things didn't go my way. Friends didn't respond immediately? Got depressed. Forgot my headphones to the gym? Went back home to do something else. I did some bad online shopping, spent my savings for the month and could not sit still without having my heart race of anxiety.\n\nThen I found out my crush had a boyfriend and got so depressed I was borderline s**cidal with even more anxiety + rage.

If they ask questions and appear open minded that\u2019s usually a good sign that this person believes they could have a meaningful relationship with someone with bipolar. \n\nThere is someone out there for everyone and not holding back your personality or emotions early on will make it clear whether they are meant for you or not. There is no sense in being with someone where your teetering on an edge wondering if your doing to much or not.

I think the biggest misconception I\u2019ve been holding on to is that if I stay on meds I\u2019ll be happy. But that\u2019s not at all the case. There\u2019s no such thing as a pill for happiness.\n\nRealization #2: Meds don\u2019t fix everything. Sure they may lower the volume but they are not a cure. There is not cure. Girl you have bipolar just accept it.\n\nRealization #3: The euphoria you feel when manic is not what happiness feels like. There\u2019s a difference between feeling euphoric while manic and feeling happy.\n\nRealization #4: You can\u2019t live in constant chaos. That\u2019s not living, it\u2019s surviving. I know you think the only time you truly feel alive is when you\u2019re manic but you know that\u2019s not sustainable and you only end up in trouble.\n\nRealization #5: Even though they don\u2019t make you happy, you do feel better while taking meds. Things are so much quieter and calmer. You can think clearly and make rational decisions. You can sleep and function like a productive member of society. \n\nI will still miss feeling so unbelievably happy though. Feeling like I am made of light. Feeling so carefree. Feeling music so deeply in my soul. Feeling like I am amazing and can do no wrong. I mourn that feeling. I just feel like I\u2019ll never feel truly happy again. "

We also have 2 toddlers (3M and 1M) and I\u2019m 17 weeks pregnant. \n\nSo my (22F) husband (23M) was admitted into a mental hospital a few days ago due to suicidal thoughts.\n\nAt first I was worried and happy he was getting help and super supportive, and just trying to hold down the fort and keep positive. But he called me the second day and told me he didn\u2019t want to come home, at first we agreed to 5 days to give the medicine time to work and for him to talk to someone and get a feel for how he feels/get his mind straight, but now he wants to stay for 10 days or longer. \n\nI got extremely upset and cut the call short. I felt so horrible for getting so mad and I just couldn\u2019t understand why he would want to stay there. \nFor some more background: I was in a mental hospital years ago and I had a traumatic experience, so I didn\u2019t want him to stay long because I don\u2019t trust mental hospitals. \nSo I kept getting more upset, while all of this is happening my youngest is constantly screaming making it really hard on me (his molars are coming in) and my heart is breaking with my oldest asking where daddy is all the time. \n\nHe called me today, and I broke down crying my eyes out. I was upset because every time he calls me he\u2019s having a great time, doesn\u2019t ask about the kids or me, cuts our calls short because he has nothing to say to me, and how he doesn\u2019t want to to come home. \n\nI just cried and yelled about how we all miss him so much, and I\u2019m happy he\u2019s getting help of course but it\u2019s hard for me to hear him say every conversation he doesn\u2019t want to come home and he\u2019s having a great time. \n\nI hung up and just cried for 20 minutes.

I just felt numb and like I could never be happy again. I lost hope. I was miserable every day and in and out of the hospital. After 25 years of trauma I cut off my abusive parents. I was so depressed I just knew my wife would leave me. But she didn\u2019t.\n\nFast forward to now and I\u2019m the most stable and happy I\u2019ve ever been in life. Our marriage is the best it has been in 5 years. I found a family that loves me for who I am. After failing and failing with medications I finally found one that worked and keeps me stable. I started to see positives in life. This paired with a daily schedule I stick to prioritizing self care and health has changed my life. \n\nAll of this being said I still battle this illness every day as I\u2019m sure you all do. It is hard to accept we\u2019re not \u201cnormal.\u201d It is hard dealing with symptoms it feels like no one else has to deal with. But hang in there, time is your friend. It doesn\u2019t happen overnight but you will start to build a toolbox of things that help minimize symptoms for you. Give yourself grace and try to remind yourself of the positives in life. Each of us are unique and special in our own way and should be proud of it. \n\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to ask me any questions, I\u2019d love to help in any way I can.

Something I\u2019ve noticed is when I encounter a new (to me) mental health professional who tries to explain to me how bipolar works. Like pal, trust me, from first hand experience I KNOW HOW IT WORKS. I\u2019ve had it my entire life. I\u2019ve had multiple times when I\u2019m with a professional who is new to me, ask what medicine I take and how it is doing for me, when were my last episodes and how long they lasted. I have had TWO professionals say my medicine isn\u2019t what I should be taking since it\u2019s an antidepressant, not a mood stabilizer. And I have to defend myself pretty much and explain that it helps me function and I feel fine with what it does for me. Why would I want to change from the medicine that I\u2019ve been on for 8 years? Just because it\u2019s not a mood stabilizer? It does what I need it to do. I even had one of them tell me \u201cit shouldn\u2019t be helping you like that\u201d well guess what, it does. Don\u2019t blame me. I had one recently try telling me that if I\u2019m on medicine then I shouldn\u2019t be having episodes. (My episodes aren\u2019t as often or as bad now, they were awful before medicine). When I tell you my jaw almost dropped. Medicine doesn\u2019t get rid of bipolar disorder. It helps make it easier to manage.

I was unstable and suicidal too, until last year, I started building stability and peace bit by bit. Nothing much changed on surface, but my life feels a lot different now.\nDepressed brain is a survival mechamism. It helps you conserve your energy in unprofitable (or dangerous) situation. But it comes with cognitive impairment. \nWhen you're depressed, you feel as if your thoughts are unchangeable truth, which makes it difficult to climb out of the pit alone. \n Right now, I believe that the best thing you can do for yourself is find hope and reasons to persist, even if it feels like there is none.\n When I started climbing out of that state,  I made a vision board and an antivision board to visualize and remind myself what I really wanted in life and didnt want, and why I should strive at all to survive.\n I listened to tons of music of all sorts, and podcasts and religious chants as a therapy. Listening to stories of people who have lived through trauma helped a lot too.\n Therapy helps yes. but I think what helps more is surrounding yourself with good people to check in with you daily - people who carry good energy to lift you up when you're down. And that takes luck, time, effort, and a ton of courage to open up your wounds to others and to ask for help. \nThis is not easy, but help will come to you. only if you ask for help. Being vulnerable and acknowledging your struggles is not a weakness. it shows strength.\n Try to find what helps you feel better, and try to keep doing that, or even better, set up a system so it happens as a natural part of your routine.\n In my case, it was drinking tea and meditating, basketball, walking at parks, finding songs that help me release pent up feelings, writing out all my random thoughts on sticky notes and then either put them on walls, or crumple and put them in a locked container (i rarely reopen it but it helps me see how dark my thoughts were later)\nJust, whatever you do, watch out not to isolate yourself for too long and spiral into your own negative thoughts.\n Let me know if you need a listening ear. I know you've got the grit and power in you. You've survived until today, and I'm so proud of you. Hope you find your stable life again.\n\nLove,\nAnonymous"

Big changes are a trigger for me to have episodes and I hadn\u2019t been able to get my meds the whole time I was unemployed, so I was a little concerned and vigilant about my mental health during this transitional period. \n\nI had to wait till Jan 1st for my benefits to kick in and be able to see my psychiatrist again for the first time in forever. I said okay I just gotta make it 1 month holding it together, that\u2019s easy! Then I had some crazy drama with my ex boyfriend which really was just the tipping point for me I guess lol I was already kind of building up to a hypo/manic episode but yeah I was there after that. I tried to schedule an appointment sooner and I got my meds refilled. It\u2019s crazy because I really did try to keep an eye out for any signs and still, I was completely blindsided by it. Someone had to point out my behavior to me and I was like ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh shit lol you\u2019re right\u2026\u2026\n\nThe nausea I felt trying to get back on my medication made me just quit outright the first time. Then eventually I contacted the psychiatrist office again asking for guidance on how to deal with that side effect, he told me how to taper back onto them so I started that and the nausea went away completely. \n\nAfter a few days I could already feel a day and night difference and I was just so stunned at where I was at mentally for a few weeks up until this point and how did I not notice more??? But this always happens to me w/ antipsychotics, I feel so DULL coming off of a manic episode that they had to end for me. I actually cannot stand it and now I\u2019m struggling to get myself to take them again. I liked feeling good. I don\u2019t want to have to just sit with myself and get through my day with no excitement and interest to everything. I have an appointment at the end of the month and I feel like I\u2019m gonna get yelled at lol. What\u2019s the point of even talking to him if I\u2019m not doing what I\u2019m supposed to be doing. The closest person in my life who keeps an eye on me has already questioned me again about seeming a little hypo so I guess the roller coaster continues yet still. \n\nAnyways do y\u2019all ever experience something similar where you feel the color sucked out of everything when you have to take meds for mania? Advice for how to suck it up?"

I\u2019m in the UK and mental health services are so stretched here so this may take up to a month\u2026 I\u2019ve had lots of time to over think about it!\n\nI\u2019ve been lurking on this subreddit for a couple of weeks and seeing the community and support is really lovely. I think that (if I am bipolar) my story is pretty similar to many here. I\u2019m 28, have been diagnosed as depressed for nearly a decade, SSRIs made me feel very odd, doctors never saw my version of mania as it didn\u2019t end in intervention so never considered bipolar. \n\nI sometimes stay up late into the night making art, I one day decided I could go and run a marathon with no training, I can go from being very withdrawn to very chatty and social, I\u2019m very enthusiastic about an idea for a short time and then lose all interest, I\u2019ve been a bit risky with dating and sex, I\u2019ll feel totally unstoppable. A lot of these would be all in the same period.\n\nI will then go to being deeply down and depressed, uncontrollably crying, I experience bad migraines in these periods too.\n\nIt\u2019s been a relentless cycle for most of my adult life.\n\nHaving this potential diagnosis feels like it could finally be an answer for me but I\u2019m also quite scared. I don\u2019t really know how to approach a potential diagnosis- I expect it will happen as my behaviour is pretty well described by bipolar. Is there anything that people found helpful after a diagnosis/ how have you found coming to terms with a change in diagnosis. Also anyone who experiences bipolar and migraine? The comorbidity rates are really high. \n\nThanks for reading!! "

This year started and i was placed in a group with my assailant. Soon after i discovered a mass on my skull that doctors have no answer for. I got fired from my job because i was sick.\n\nLast December was one of the darkest times I\u2019ve had in years. I was attempting nearly twice a week, SH relapsed, started taking more pills and drinking and smoking still. All on and off campus. I was existing only in between my panic attacks. Winter break came and though i was still depressed, i calmed down a lot. \n\nI returned to my city last week and my symptoms started to ramp up again. Panic attacks, doom spirals. The semester starts today. I\u2019m calm and really sedated right now, but I don\u2019t want to go back. I have grown to be an unrecognizable person to myself. I have no passion for my art or education, I am extremely distrusting of everyone around me, the people in that school make my skin crawl, I feel weak, and I just think I\u2019m a fuckin loser.

I feel i'm capable of really great things but i'm worried I won't be able to consistently hold down a job. I'd like to be making at least 80k+ per year. Right now i've only worked minimum wage for the most part. I am a creative person, sometimes I don't know what is worse - the potential that i'll never have a \"living wage,\" or it will kill my soul trying to get there. My field doesnt have to be creative, i'm mostly concerned about working so hard to get to a certain lifestyle and then ruining it for myself or quitting - ruining my reputation. Would appreciate responses from anyone regarding their career paths/ job experience etc. I haven't worked since that time, I had saved 14k while working and with a recent episode I lost about half. I'm happy i'm not in debt but I think about the hours I slaved, all the times I put money in envelopes aside and didn't spend money - all really for nothing but another shitty lesson now. \n\nThe job search is causing me to fall into depressive patterns I haven't experienced in some months. All these jobs are well below the living wage. I'm \"interested\" in trades but even carpentry wages for where I live starting out (and on average) are below the living wage or barely touching it. I don't really know where to go or what to do. I have a film production diploma and am going to try entering the film industry in early spring but i'm on an on call list. I want to be making money between now and spring but feel like im going to have to quit on the spot to fufill showing up at whatever job they shove me into. The positions i'm written down for would be nowhere near 80k though even with experience. I graduated on the honours and presidents list. I have a great work ethic and feel like i'm capable of achieving a lot. I know i hold myself back but I also feel bipolar doing that too. I was originally diagnosed BIP1, now my psych after 2 years says he is leaning more to schizoaffective. I was fine to hear that in the room as I had my suspicions but small parts of me feel like my life is getting ruined before its started. I am really scared of what my future will look like. I am not really suicidal anymore after almost a decade of feeling that way but I can't help that it crosses my mind now. I don't want to die but it feels like I won't be able to live longterm especially when my mother dies eventually. I am scared that containing to live means watching me rip apart my life every couple of years. I don't really have other family who care, she has saved me from myself many times. Any words of encouragement are a blessing. Thank you. "

Over the past year, I was manic and I ruined my entire life and then immediately entered a really bad depressive episode that lasted 4 months. In this time, I became at terms with death and felt nothing but pure emptiness and misery. I had a plan laid out to kill myself in November, the only thing that kept me on this earth was the fact that my boyfriend at the time would come home to find me dead, and I couldn\u2019t bare hurting someone else after all of the people I hurt over this last year. \n\nI couldn\u2019t get out of bed or on the couch, I either wasn\u2019t eating or was eating everything in sight, wasn\u2019t sleeping for days then would sleep 12-14 hours the next few days and it kept repeating itself. I am only 17, this is all so new to me still. Before I was manic I always have felt things so intensely, always had really bad mood swings, always had the negative feedback loop of my thoughts and anxiety. I thought it was just depression but when I went manic and then went into a very very deep depression, which was by far the lowest I have been my entire life (I have had an abusive childhood, bad home life, self hatred, friends fucking me over, bullying, a 2 year toxic relationship, eating disorders that almost killed me, etc) but I was never ever that low in life. The guilt of hurting people, the regret I had, the loss of my first true love, my everything, was gone. I lost myself, quit my job of over a year, dropped out of college, and started to self harm really badly. \n\nI don\u2019t want to do this again, but it is like I cannot control it. Everything reminds me of what I did to my first love, my boyfriendish (complicated atm) is moving 10 hours away and him being the only thing that kept me here makes it scarier. It doesn\u2019t help that I have no friends at all, people will talk to me and act like they\u2019re my best friend and I will help them, care for them, support them, love them, but it seems the moment I let that guard down they either pick someone else to hangout with or talk to or just slowly stop talking to me. I can\u2019t help but think that I am either just unlikeable, boring, both? Or maybe I just don\u2019t click with people. I never have clicked with people, and I probably never will either. Either way, I have no friends, and my mom doesn\u2019t really ever listen to anything I tell her about, even when I\u2019m having a meltdown she\u2019s too busy on her phone and not paying attention to me. My sister still involves herself with my first love because they\u2019re really close and she talks about him and it hurts, so I try to stay away. When I try to talk to her she will listen to what I say then ask to hit my vape the moment I stop talking. I feel like no one hears me, I am starting to feel how I felt before. \n\nBeing alone was fine before but now, I genuinely just want friends and a support system, but I don\u2019t have that and never have had that. I am just feeling really down, falling into those patterns from the last time. I\u2019m even on meds now and it\u2019s still really bad. I know they\u2019re not supposed to fix it all but it doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re stabilizing anything. I just don\u2019t know what to do.

    "content": "I've seen a few questions on bipolar disorder and empathy flying around Reddit. So I did some digging, because I also feel like my ability to empathise is affected in some way.\n\nHowever, results seem so inconclusive. Some studies in the 2010s showed some effects on empathy in people with BD, including decreased cognitive empathy (i.e. we find it harder to read and understand people's mental state), and increased affective empathy (i.e. we feel or share other people's mental state to a greater extent). Some more recent studies have found that there actually aren't any effects on empathy in people with BD. Various neurological studies have shown that there are changes in the brain regions that are thought to affect empathy, but it is unclear if these changes actually produce an effect.\n\nPersonally, I do resonate with the decreased cognitive empathy and increased affective empathy. I often find it difficult to read people's faces for what their emotions are, especially when manic. But if it's obvious or they say something, especially when it's a negative emotion, I almost find myself disproportionately affected by it.\n\nSo, I'm obviously not doing a study here, but do these facts resonate with you? Or not? I also don't doubt that my feelings about how I emphasize are more rooted in my upbringing and socialization. But is this a shared sentiment?\n\n"

    "content": "Okay. I am bipolar. Today I feel worse than I've felt in a long time. My meds have no effect on me today. I know what I did. I know I kept pushing myself. \n\nFirst, I asked questions of someone who I knew wouldn't give me answers. Then, the therapy. It was a lot today. I was ready. I swear I was! But it got to me. And then I shared. I shared a revelation, and I expected a reaction. It turned into me comforting someone else. \n\nI've broken today. All the hard work has gone. Rebuild. Again. I can't rebuild on this faulty foundation. And I can't seem to make myself remove the fault. I was given the chance. It would've worked. I could've gone into therapy with a broken heart, but a lighter soul. \n\nThere's the part of me that says that I am the fault. And in some ways that's true. But I've invited someone into my life who is not given to falling for my masks. Someone who has so many masks themselves that they cannot remember their own face. And this person destroys me. The destruction began before I knew that it wasn't coming from me, and no matter how hard I try I cannot stop the wrecking ball in their control.\n\nMy delusions are making it harder. Is it possible I'm feeling the destruction in their mind, and I'm taking it for myself? Are these feelings actually mine, they are so different from who I've always been? Are they begging me to stay close, or is that what I want from them? I'm here to help, the universe sent me to heal this person, who am I to fight that? They gave me a piece of their soul for safekeeping, today I had a fight with this piece of soul and ordered it to go back, it was ready to be whole again, and I needed peace from someone else's feelings.\n\nSo now I'm alone in my body, but the peace I was expecting has not come. I'm still alone. I still haven't accepted that the future I can see so clearly in my head was just a fantasy to begin with. \n\nAnd I want a drink. I want to drown it all out like I used to. I want the deadened feeling that comes with drinking too much for too long. I want the freedom of having given up on life, and realizing that the only person who could've ever saved me was me, and I wasn't going to waste my time trying anymore. That was the life I left, for the promise of happiness and security. I squandered that life, my undiagnosed bipolar fighting and winning against the calm I had finally accomplished.\n\nI should've rested more. I should've taken a break. I shouldn't have asked questions that I knew were going to cause this reaction. But I'm always fine until I'm not. I always have a handle on it until I don't. I'm always manic until I'm depressed. And my depression is no longer pure. I can't simply give up, put on my dead eyes and exist until I don't anymore. Now my depression comes with questions, insane delusions, and anxiety. My meds can't touch what my brain insists on experiencing. \n\nWhat if, when I wake up, I learn I'm going to keep feeling this? What is the point of continuing to grow and learn, when the result is everything hurts so much more? I know my wants and needs and patterns, but now I know the void must be filled by me. There is nothing left of me. Most is given to my disorder, the rest I hand out freely, hoping it's enough to fill someone else's void. \n\nMy curse is this: I feel everything when I want to feel nothing. I feel nothing when I want to feel everything. And in between, I cannot think."

She has never seeked help, and has always been extremely abusive to both my brother (24m), even more so to me. I have been living with her for the past few weeks, and have remembered just how truely awful she can be and how frequently I am triggered by her behaviour. I am on the right meds, i attend therapy as often as I can afford, I am a good kid. I know that I am a good daughter. I\u2019m tricky sometimes but i am doing my best, I promise. And it seems as though she\u2019s hated me every chance she gets. Every time i offer an olive branch, a chance at a normal conversation, she says something needlessly cruel. I have a feeling she consistently complains about me to everyone around her, i feel as though my coworkers, my family, random adults i bump into on the street, they all know me and despise me. My mother has never taken accountability for her actions, and if she has, she was \u2018manipulated\u2019 into it, its never her fault. She has shifted situations into me being the primary manipulator and liar, i could recount so many times she has said something awful only to be called a gaslighter. \n\nMy mother is extremely uneducated when it comes to bipolar, although she states to know more about it and has suffered more from it than me or my father. I feel as though she uses my diagnosis to gain sympathy and try to get reactions out of me to demonise me. \n\nI\u2019m moving in a few days. I\u2019m an adult. How do I navigate this relationship? I\u2019m constantly triggered by even the idea of her or what she might say. I want her to seek help. I want her to be a mother. I don\u2019t understand why she hates me so much. \n\nHow do i stop being triggered as much by her? Even when i\u2019m away from her for extended periods of time she finds ways to trigger both depressive and manic episodes."

It's out of character considering the face that I'm incredibly insecure about my body.  I've also went on a chat \"roulette\" type of site and did sexual acts. Looking back, I feel like a perverted monster.

I [M20] recently went to see a psychiatrist for the first time due to feeling depressed and anxious for like 2-3 months for seemingly no reason. They put me on an anti-depressant and almost immediately things started to feel better. I felt euphoric and finally deep-cleaned my room overnight. I didn't sleep for three days and didn't see a problem with it. Eventually, my doctor called to check in and I told them how I felt... they then informed me that I was probably in a hypomanic episode. \n\nThey prescribed me some stuff to make me sleep and told me to stop taking the anti-depressant immediately. But while I waited for the prescription, things got worse. The other day I convinced myself that I was somehow superhuman and everyone around me was jealous. I also had a \"delightful\" conversation with my car radio, which I thought was somehow channeling the messages of dead people. I called my doctor and they scheduled me an appointment this week to talk about the possibility I'm bipolar.\n\nMy new medication has since brought me down from that level, but I still feel like I'm running on a motor and can't stop. I just yelled at my boyfriend for canceling our plans today and then proceeded to call him back immediately crying and begging him not to leave me (which he says he never intended to do). I feel like everyone is suddenly staring at me like I'm crazy. I also overheard my roommate saying she is starting to sleep with her door locked in case I suddenly \"lose it\". \nI just feel so alone right now. \n\nPrior to all of this happening, I was the guy that everyone went to for their troubles or when they were in crisis. But now that I'm the one struggling, everyone is suddenly too busy. Or worse, they're scared of me. I just can't shake this feeling that I'm somehow making all of this up to be self-destructive or something like that. I feel like I'm losing my mind."

I just want to hear something good for a change.\n\nEven when I look beyond myself, it\u2019s the same story. The news, social media, everything\u2014it\u2019s just one bad thing after another. The world feels so messed up.\n\nSo, I\u2019m asking for some good news, something that\u2019ll make me smile, even if it\u2019s just for a moment. It doesn\u2019t have to be big\u2014maybe you got a good grade on a test, you enjoyed your favourite meal today, or you heard a joke so bad it was funny. Anything.\n\nOne good news to make me smile, just one good news."

It felt like my energy levels were constantly betraying me.\n2. **Impulsive decisions**: Whether it was spending too much money, starting a million projects, or saying things I regretted, I couldn\u2019t understand why I acted so impulsively.\n3. **Mood swings**: One moment, I\u2019d be euphoric, talking non-stop, and feeling unstoppable, and the next, I\u2019d sink into a pit of hopelessness. It was exhausting and made me question my own stability.\n4. **Trouble sleeping**: I couldn\u2019t sleep during manic phases no matter how hard I tried, and during depressive phases, all I wanted to do was sleep but still felt exhausted.\n5. **Relationship challenges**: I often felt like my emotions were too much for the people around me, and I struggled with guilt after arguments or miscommunications.\n\nGetting the diagnosis has been overwhelming but also a relief\u2014I finally have an explanation for what\u2019s been going on all these years.

Medicated and pretty much episode free outside of pregnancy and post-partum. It took until my mid-20s to really take it seriously and commit to a consistent medication regime and regular therapy. Doing so absolutely turned my life around after leaving a fair amount of chaos in my wake. I've also got that sweet ASD/OCD/CPTSD combo and some anxiety.\n\nI work in an inpatient mental health setting and am currently applying for other mental health clinician jobs after finishing my degree in December. My question is - how do others protect their wellbeing when working with people experiencing mental health crises? Working in an acute setting I obviously see a lot of people in crisis. Like a lot of people with a trauma background/mental illness I have a lot of empathy and feel things quite deeply. Sometimes I sit with people whose story mirrors my own to some extent. \n\nCurrently I have professional supervision and a session with my psychologist every month to talk through any scenarios that may have triggered me or feelings/emotions that have come up. I have good boundaries at work and I'm not projecting my shit on clients or anything, what I'm more concerned about is avoiding vicarious trauma and protecting my wellbeing. In my profession they talk about self-care a lot, but I'm not sure that a warm bath quite cuts it sometimes! \n\nHope that makes sense! Looking forward to reading about everyone strategies. "

When we moved to Mesa, I started hanging out with the stoners. We were all outcasts.\n\nI've seen other people get opportunities, but I either got passed over or was too late. At one point, I lived in a house with my girlfriend's mother. She ended up in a mental hospital, and we couldn\u2019t pay rent, so we got kicked out. While camping, the police showed up with guns, claiming someone reported that we were shooting at them. Of course, they didn\u2019t find any guns.\n\nEven now, life doesn\u2019t seem to let up.

I said no, he said \"FINE GUESS I'LL GO KMS\".\n\nAnd so I texted back, \"Please, when we are disagreeing, don't joke about killing yourself. If this isn't a joke, please go to a hospital.

And it *was* okay on his end. But it's not at all okay because of me...\n\nI asked if he was okay, and he said he was, but now I'm scared he's lying because he's afraid of telling me the truth.

I want to tell him he could tell me anything because it's true, but what if he doesn't trust me to hear his emotions?\n\nI tried to backpedal and apologize because I missed his joke. But he said it was okay, and I didn't want to beat a dead horse and say \"but are you okay\" when he said he was. I don't believe him. I think I've hurt him.\n\nAnd so now I can't ask if he's okay again because he may think I'm annoying. And if he thinks I'm annoying he won't tell me the truth. And then I'm burying his emotions despite that being the whole reason of me asking if he's okay, to make sure he doesn't have to bury his emotions.

Around six months ago I was put on adhd medication to hopefully counteract my never ending avolition associated with my bipolar and adhd.\n\nI would like to put preface on the fact that I am a very high-functioning bipolar and have an extreme level of self-awareness, therefore I am keen to recognizing my warning signs of episodes, etc.\nRecently I've started to notice some strange things.\n\nI've always had spurts of paranoia, or disconnections from reality, however I've never experienced something quite like this.\nOver the past few months my days have been blending together, I don't have recollection of days previous of the present, and time doesn't feel real.\n\nI don't know if anyone else will genuinely understand this feeling, but I feel as if due to my bipolar disorder I am very prone to being triggered by stress. During times of high stress I tend to disconnect, everything around me becomes foggy, I'm having a hard time understanding what people are trying to say to me, my vision morphs, and I start developing delusions.\n\nThis feels as if it is a more consistent and nagging feeling. Based on my understanding, this could be early warning signs of psychosis; which is why I am mentioning predromal psychosis. I also tend to have spurts of paranoia at night. I refuse to sleep without my door locked.\nI've also been very negligent to spending time with family & people, I find that I get irritated quickly, and would much rather be alone.\n\nI feel as if there are bits and pieces of an episode of psychosis, or a severe episode of mania slowly seeping through the cracks.\nWhy l'm posting here is because l'm curious on what people's warning signs are, or how they may have felt before headed into psychosis/mania.\n\nI have experienced manic episodes before, however psychosis is something that I have not experienced yet, and I know with my condition and family history I am very prone to it.\n\nSo questions are:\n\nWhat were the few days/weeks like leading up to your psychosis?\n\nWhat are some warning signs you later on recognized to be your warning signs of an episode of mania/psychosis?\n"

I did everything to be happy and I'm not losing hope (I planned for suicide 3 years ago but I didn't and I chose to not think of that again).\n\nI need to see your opinions because I believe you experienced a lot of pain in your life and you have a mentality that could help.\n\nThank you"

    "content": "I have been on a mood stabilizer for bipolar 2 since 2019, and it pretty much has worked perfectly since the beginning. I haven't had any bipolar mood swings since 2019. I am also BPD (in diagnostic remission now) so I had mood swings related to that after being treated for bipolar. Sometimes it has residual effects even to this day.\n\nI have been having really intense depressive episodes with psychosis, that last for a day or two, then go away for a couple days, then come back, then go away. It's been a week and a half, everything was great for years and then they weren't. It only lasts a couple days at a time, but even when it \"goes away,\" I definitely am still feeling unmotivated and detached.\n\nThe episodes definitely remind me of my bipolar depression/mixed episodes back in early 2019. But I'm experiencing more psychosis than I remembered having before.... It is definitely not BPD. I know what borderline mood swings and splitting feels like, and it's always caused by some conflict or stressor. This isn't caused by anything I can put my finger on, and it's about 100x more intense. It's not emotional distress, it's full blown numbness, not able to feel love, being annoyed/angry at my family, delusional, feeling like all of my loved ones are manipulating me, can't get out of bed/eat/shower kind of stuff. Is this typical for medication failure?\n\nI have a psychiatry appointment next week, so I'm waiting as patiently as possible for that. I hope to try a medication adjustment, but I am curious if you all have any anecdotal experiences or feedback on what to pay attention to/how to cope for now. Thanks."

    "content": "If you have experienced manic episodes due to BP1, you want to live a normal life but the possibility of having a manic episode at any time makes it hard to live without fear. The fear, in turn, makes it hard to live a normal life. \n\nSo I've been finding things to tell myself to cope with this reality. This list is by no means conclusive, but it has been working for me so far so I thought I'd share it, in case anyone is curious or may benefit.\n\n1. If you're not manic right now, find a way to enjoy it. You're healthy, at this time! Enjoy! This can mean merely living in the present and finding joy in that. The fact that you know what it's like to be sick/manic may make you appreciate the moments of wellness even more. Also, please don't let myself ruin those moments of wellness with fear for the future. It's wasting a good thing :)\n\n2. If you do have a manic episode, it may really suck and your life can be burnt to ashes. But you can always rebuild! Always. You have before and you'll do it again. You may not end up leading the life you imagined you'd lead but who really does, anyway? \n\n3. Another redditor u/FunTone6524 said to me that your life can never be fully ruined due to a manic episode. This was a revelation to hear and consistent with my experiences. Following my manic episodes, I experienced a lot of suffering and while certain things were ruined, many valuable things remained and were even strengthened (like my relationship with my family, who showed up for me). That insight gave me some comfort and relief. There will always be things of value left behind after a manic episodes. \n\n4. We are not alone. There are so many of us. Experiencing this illness and this pain. That makes me feel love for all of us and makes the struggle seem less daunting, because we're all in it together. I feel connected to others who experience this illness in a way that makes me feel a strong sense of kinship.\n\n  \n5. I don't compare myself to others who are without bipolar and \"healthier.\" This is where my studies in Buddhism have been helpful. I've tried to \"let go\" of my attachment of comparing myself to others, because that attachment is unhealthy and leads me to feelings of dread. I focus on myself. \"Letting go\" in other areas has also proven healthy. For example, I've let go of my attachment to the life I wanted to lead. It didn't happen. It probably wasn't possible. It was a construct. My life is my life, nothing less and nothing more, and all I can do it make the most of it, as much as I am able to.\n\n  \nThat's all for now! But I plan to refine this list over time and add to it. I'd love to hear some thoughts, if you're willing. My best to you and your lives. \n\n  \n"

But the conversation ended with him showing his frustration and said I need to work on my finances better and stop spending money on stupid shit. \n\nI totally get it, but where can I draw the line of I\u2019m being stupid with money because of this fucking bipolar and I\u2019m just a person that\u2019s careless with money? Just feeling really sad, and grateful, and embarrassed - a pile of emotions.. \n\nThanks for listening \ud83d\ude42\u200d\u2195\ufe0f"

My mother was bed bound most of the time with her bi-polar. I was responsible for everything-writing checks for utility bills, school notes, staying home to babysit if my siblings were sick.\n\nOne summer day I found myself in front of the bathroom mirror watching my arm weep. It wasn\u2019t my first self harm incident, but definitely the worse. I don\u2019t remember how, or doing it, but reality had to be dealt with so I called my mom at work.\n\nI ended up in the psych ward for 6 months. I missed homecoming, my friends, school. I was diagnosed with \u2019manic depression\u2019 and \u2018obsession with death\u2019. I was an 80\u2019s goth, so yeah, whatever. When I went back, kids thought it was \u2018cool\u2019. Of course it wasn\u2019t. \n\nToday I was watching a teenage movie and I saw so many things I missed out on. I had always pretended I was too cool to do things like prom, senior pictures, sports games, school dances for holidays. \n\nI think now I was embarrassed because of my illness, because of my family situation (being poor), and just being shy. My bipolar and anxiety made me too nervous to be around all those people. Girls were ordering prom dresses from catalogs to be tailored. I was trying to figure out if I was going to have a good day (mania) or be depressed and bed bound like my mother. \n\nHigh school was hard enough being poor, but having mood swings was even worse. I got in a lot of fights, wasn\u2019t shy about sex, drinking, and self harm. \n\nAt 53, I still have self inflicted scars, scars I let other people give me, and enough memories I once thought were good times, but were really end results of my illness. \n\nIt\u2019s not easy being young and sick.

My most recently and stable experience was taking moods stabilizers for about 2 years. and it did kinda stabilized me BUT I went into a more \"lowered\" state and the highs became rusty and very few. My emotions became less explosive, but I  felt heavy. The truth is that I still had crises and depressed phases, even with medication. I stopped a few months ago and in a way I feel better----- I'm in a stable moment, I've been in therapy for years and I'm already 30+, so, relatively safe, I felt the need to \"get to know myself\" and stopped the medication .\n\nAnyway, just like in the medication era, I have crises and mood swings, but now with more intensity both ways and more \"highs\", even a few days with hypomania. \nBut im still TIRED with the inconstancy and all the WEIGHT of dealing with this shit, even more so feeling so alone and unseen, I'm thinking about going to the psychiatrist again but for what? Nothing ever \"resolves\" and it even gets worse. Lately, at least I've been more productive during hypomanic crises and I'm still \"stable\", so why change that? \n\nBut i have this URGE get better, to function, to be helped, saved or stroke by a fucking miracle. Somedays are unbearable. One day i can barely get out bed, take a shower or work and one day I wake up feeling like a force of nature, with so much energy it actually hurts and i have to do something to let it out a bit or i'll explode. Its hard to make plans, to keep relationships, its hard to work, to live and the worst part is: We are either labeled as CRAZY or we're just NOT taken seriously. And i dont know which is worse. \n\n I feel that bipolarity is living camped on the precipice, always at the mercy of external circumstances and with the feeling of being \"one circumstance away\" from going completely bat shit crazy, or \"one sleep away\" from walking up and finding out you lost everything. We don't always get real support in the health area, especially if we can't invest a lot of money in it, at the same time we struggle mentally, we still have to try our best to keep our jobs, pay the bills and still maintain relationships, the house, ourselves.... I always feel overwhelmed, having to manage my external and internal life. I'm always apologizing, justifying myself, sometimes having to lie because the truth is just too crazy, incomprehensible or pathetic. The amont of energy spent on masking, trying to improve, improving, and falling again - Its a rollercoster. And it's an invisible battle. Anyway, just a rant. I'm tired of being like this. I just wanted to have more money ans stability to have all the necessary psychological and psychiatric support, to no longer need to adapt to a world dynamic that I don't fit into and to be able to focus on my art. Until this miracle happens, I'm exhausted.\n\nPS: At the same time i hate being like that, i also LOVE the magic in bipolar and maybe one day i will post a tribute too all the \"perks and blessings\" that came with this curse. But today im just tired. \n"

Uhh idk tho my friends have derived manic episodes as feeling like your \"on top of the world\" or \"can do anything\" or \"better than others\" and like a euphoric state that can send you spiraling into bad or dangerous decisions and can last from weeks to months and they happen randomly or caused by events that make them feel like that and I think that's happened to me but idk. I definitely go thru depressive states and have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety but tbh I still barely know anything about any of these disorders other than it makes me wanna die lol.

During the tail-end of the depression, I took a workshop on meditation that was supposed to help me with anxiety and depression, but instead I developed what was diagnosed as conversion disorder (now known as functional neurological disorder) stemming from repressed childhood trauma.  I was physically disabled/unable to work/attend school for over a year. \n\nWhen my symptoms were more under control, I started back up at community college and after a few years transferred back to the university I dropped out from.  My last year and a half at the university, I again had severe depression that resulted in getting bad grades and also distancing myself from the professors who would be writing me letters of rec. I haven't spoken to them since before I graduated which was 5 years ago...

I just got diagnosed with bipolar, and there\u2019s a lot of emotions that come with that but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I really don\u2019t think my therapist is good for me but I can\u2019t tell if this is just me over reacting so here\u2019s just what\u2019s going on \n1) I am constantly triggered in therapy. Accusations and judgment gets under my skin a lot. Every time I\u2019m trying to open up about different traumatic events that have left my brain scrambled, her first question is always \u201cwhat did you do to deserve it?\u201d \u201cDid you do something wrong first and this was just the reaction?\u201d Which I\u2019m sure happens but I end up spending most of the appointment defending myself and explaining all the events before hand. Example: I was dealing with a creep at work and she seemed confident that I must have been flirting with him. I know for sure that the second I met him I got weird vibes and immediately started avoiding him as much as possible (I have a lot of trauma with men) so I know I never led the guy on\n2) my dad is also her client and he doesn\u2019t like me much. Love but not like. My mom\u2019s abusive and has untreated bipolar and my dad is the enabler. Because I always spoke up about something needing to be done about the situation and he has shut me up saying that everything\u2019s fine. He hates accountability and will blame everyone but himself. And I can\u2019t shake the feeling that my therapist is in some way taking his side. When came to my childhood trauma he likes to say I lie or exaggerate things while I was literally begging for help. It just seems like my therapist doesn\u2019t believe me at all\n3)she and my dad are strict catholic conservatives so sometimes therapy sometimes takes a weird controlling direction where she wants to discuss politics, she make condescending remarks about my dyed hair and band t-shirts. Asks about me dressing modestly and sex life. Like always sees me as a degenerate of some sort and doesn\u2019t respect any my personal life choices saying that her office is a place for her to practice her faith freely. I\u2019m not anti religious but I really don\u2019t respect the weird \u201cyou got to live your life exactly like mine\u201d stuff\n4) the only helpful advice I have gotten so far is how to properly set up a boundary. Everything else seems to be her desperately trying to catch me in something to prove her bias. She looks dead inside until she suddenly gets excited and exclaims something a long lines of \u201cI got you now!\u201d Or \u201cyou can\u2019t fool me\u201d and then cue the accusation and my explanation of how \u201cno I didn\u2019t do that. This is what I did\u201d and it takes every inch of my being to stay calm because I feel like I never get to problem solving\nThis is getting to the point where I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m even bipolar but I\u2019m not medicated yet and it could be just my view of the situation but I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m being as honest as possible.

I\u2019ve been in therapy since I was 12 (off and on but mostly on), I\u2019ve been in groups, DBT, IOP, I\u2019ve tried ECT. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019ve done it all. And I\u2019m exhausted. \n\nI probably contribute a lot to that exhaustion though because I fight this disease every step of the way. Most of the time I can\u2019t even admit that I have bipolar. I can admit to some kind of chemical imbalance, but do I actually believe I have bipolar?? Sometimes yes and sometimes no. I have such a hard time with meds. I have a lot of paranoia and a lot of that paranoia has to do with taking meds. Not just bipolar meds but all meds. I have all these thoughts that invade my brain and I can\u2019t shake them. \n\nI went off meds last September because of that paranoia. I think that people are trying to control me. That I\u2019m not bipolar and because of that I don\u2019t need meds and people telling me that I need them are trying to control my brian. Turning me into a mindless robot or trying to poison me. I just have a really hard time with them. \n\nBut I went to see my psychiatrist today and got back on lithium because I seriously can\u2019t take it anymore and recognized that I needed to do something. And everyone in my life is so happy about me being back on meds. But I\u2019m still struggling. I hate this so much. I don\u2019t want to deal with this anymore. It\u2019s so painful. And I\u2019m just exhausted. \n\nI just think of that scene in shameless where Ian goes to get meds and asks the psychiatrist how long he needs to take them for. And she basically tells him forever. It\u2019s forever. I just can\u2019t seem to accept it. I keep thinking that things will change or I\u2019ll be different and I never am. I think it\u2019s time for me to grow up and accept it. I\u2019m just struggling. \n\nIf you gotten this far into my rant I thank you. But I want to hear your story. What has your journey looked like? What has worked and what hasn\u2019t? Has accepting this illness been difficult for you too? \n\nBipolar is not for the weak. You have survived 100% of your hardest days. You will continue to survive and thrive. I am proud of you \u2764\ufe0f"

But this morning I decided to double check the time, and I noticed it said 1/24... something similar happened about a week ago where I remembered seeing the dollar amount in my account as 2 something. But when my husband looked, it said 3 something and no transactions had occurred in between. \n\nIt makes me feel like I can't trust anything I think/know. Like I'm not in control anymore. The good news is I had felt myself getting off track, so I have been using notes, pictures, and  even my husband to help keep me on the right track.. it's just unsettling not knowing what's true right now. I am trying to stick with simple tasks I can't really mess up as well; if that makes sense.. \n\nI was just wondering if this is a common type of thing for people in episodes.

I thought it was a little weird that he dismissed my small victories... and THEN...\n\nTurns out he was thinking p much the same exact thing except he thought it was a good idea to basically yell at me for having my mental illness and struggling with it for so long (there were so many factors to this depressive episode. It's ridiculous. It should have only taken a few months.) \n\nI SHUT DOWN. There was NO way I was going to tell him how I felt about him then.

We did our best to pass the time together. We made up games with the limited items they would give us and developed real camaraderie. One day my roommate who had been in a wheel chair got up and decided his injury was healed enough. I was in terrible spirits deep depression after coming down from mania.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 when I was 17 and more recently have been diagnosed with PTSD as well as exploring a possible ADHD diagnosis.\n\nI lost my grandfather (who I was extremely close to) in September 2023 and my uncle committed suicide in December 2023. I also had approximately 4-5 other significant life triggers within that time frame, which lead me to have the worst manic episode I\u2019ve had since 2009. (In 2009, I mistakenly thought that I was depressed because I had a cutting problem that lead me to six 51/50s within that year\u2026 When I recently learned that those were actually manic episodes because I had extreme life triggers that no 17 year old should have had to experience.) \n\nThe manic episode I had in December 2023 to January 2024 was so extreme that I physically felt the come down from it - everything slowed down and I was drinking up to 6 espresso shots daily to try to get my energy back because I didn\u2019t understand what was going on. \n\nApproximately a year ago, the results of my manic episodes slapped me in the face and my life has felt like it\u2019s going downhill ever since. I developed terrible panic attacks, constantly had to call out of work because of the depressive episodes. \n\nAlthough I was (and still am) very proud of myself for pushing through in my professional life when I\u2019d normally abruptly quit in the past but I can\u2019t help but wonder if that ended up hurting me in the end. My job let me go in August 2024 for supposedly \u201ctaking advantage of my accommodations\u201d (which was false btw) and I\u2019ve been in a massive depressive rut ever since. \n\nNormally when I\u2019m unemployed (I have so many gaps in my resume because I can\u2019t hold a job\u2026 I always quit) I develop some sort of routine to keep myself productive. This time around I\u2019ve struggled daily. I cannot feel rested no matter how much I sleep. I have gained weight, which I already have body dysmorphia so that\u2019s definitely not helping. (\ud83d\ude43) I\u2019ve been applying to jobs left and right\u2026 Have only gotten rejection letters.  It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be productive - I feel physically and mentally exhausted. \n\nI have a good medical team behind me - great psychiatrist and recently found a decent psychologist. But I feel as though I\u2019m a lost cause because I haven\u2019t felt like myself in over a year. \n\nHas anyone else experienced anything similar? I really just don\u2019t know what else to do\u2026 I feel as though I keep trying to do everything I\u2019m supposed to do in my treatment but it\u2019s not working.

Its been amazing for me and I live a relatively normal life (I know this is not always the case and I feel very fortunate to have been able to find something that works on the first try). More background on me as a person, I am relatively active and have an extensive background in health and wellness (this is not a post about advice on changes to that). For the last 10 years I maintained the same weight even after getting on meds. \n\nThe issue arose when my pharmacy switched my manufacturer of my meds without informing me around 6 or 8 months ago. The meds werent working for my symptoms and I gained weight within a month. I promptly contacted the pharmacy to have them switch back to the other manufacturer and had no problems with my symptoms again after that. The issue is that the weight and food noise from being on the other meds has not gone away. I was on a common prescription weightloss drug for a month or two right after the med mixup which helped with the food noise but the weight didnt budge so I decided to get off of it. I am by no means at an unhealthy weight but I am VERY uncomfortable in the body I have now. \n\nSo my main question for everyone here is has anyone had this problem and been able to get the food noise and weight off again? I am worried this will just be the rest of my life and its very hard for me dealing with the food noise. I do have some ed tendencies that I have \"recovered\" from mostly but this issue is flaring some of that up. I exercise and eat for health and know its not about the number on the scale. I just want to feel like my normal self before those meds messed me up. \n\nAdditional info: I have a therapist and do work with her on these things too.\n\nThanks in advance!!"

There\u2019s also a sense of serotonin (I think that\u2019s what it is?) - like this feeling of being cared for. I appreciate it. That being said though I still feel like I\u2019m figuring myself out, or figuring out who I am. What else can I expect on meds? \n\nI\u2019ve always loved horror stories, Edgar Allan Poe etc. - they\u2019re a wonderful expressive way of exploring darkness. Now it feels like I\u2019ve been living my own especially given the stuff that landed me in the hospital.

A year ago, I attempted suicide and shortly after, developed PTSD.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m working through that last one through EMDR, and my therapist is good. I\u2019m gaining more clarity over time, and can actually think about what happened without reliving that moment.\n\nIronically, it is that clarity that I now find distressing. Because:\n\n1. That attempt was not an isolated incident, but the result of a half-decade long spiral with increasingly dangerous suicidal behaviors.\n2. Before, I thought that I very well could have died. I now know that it\u2019s worse. My death was overwhelmingly the most likely outcome,\u00a0 with sheer coincidence saving me. **Medically speaking, I should be dead**.\n\nThis is bringing forth a lot of existential feelings and questions. Sometimes the world feels surreal and I feel disconnected, as if I am far away. Sometimes I feel like I am a dead man walking, living on borrowed time. Sometimes, the death I narrowly missed feels more real than the life I have right now.\n\nReading this back, I think I must be insane. I don\u2019t want to die, there\u2019s too much remaining.

But the weird and new thing is how irritating sounds are. Loud sounds, ringing like bells and phones, tv and videos, people talking or shouting. I always liked the quiet and needed quiet sounds but not to this extent. I feel like clawing my brain if someone played an annoying video next me. I feel my blood boiling if the tv is loud and annoying. Anyone else experienced this?

I have been on a good medication regiment and I did major improvement several years ago with working out and therapy. Unfortunately my hallucinations have started back up again. My most common one is seeing flashes of light when there isn't one irl. I told my partner about these coming back and he completely dismissed me. He told me I'm always so negative and extreme, and jump to hallucinations as an \"excuse\". I feel as though I can no longer talk to him about them when they happen. It sucks because I usually use other people to gauge if it is real or not.\n\nAny advice on how to proceed from here? I am planning on talking to my therapist about it tomorrow, but I would love to get some insights from this community."

I must mention I recently decided to go off of my medication under doctor supervision, which was a huge mistake. It\u2019s not an excuse for the behavior, but it could be a cause for the irrational decisions. I\u2019m just so mad at myself. I\u2019m embarrassed.

So i decided to come back to my doctor (dude is on frontlines and still helps people) and he immediately diagnosed Bipolar Disorder 2nd group.\n\nI'm scared because people in Ukraine don't want to understand people with mental disorders and are afraid of them, they think they are disabled, like people without arms and legs who need constant supervision and constant treatment in a mental hospital.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm glad that I finally know the exact diagnosis, that it is relatively mild, without strong manic episodes, although I'm afraid that I will never recover and become \"normal.\" and will always have that stupid idea \"I never finish anything I start, so it's not even worth trying\" in my head, will never take my dreams seriously.\n\nHow do you live with it?

They see me. I also think that being in a relationship with someone has much more of a likeliness of hurting them than it has of hurting me. For that reason only, it would be extremely selfish for me to get into a relationship with someone knowing I don't care as much as they do and I probably never will.

After starting my meds at the lowest dose I started integrating into therapeutic doses pretty quickly bc of my comorbidities (ptsd and mdd) but I'm so grateful for the changes I've seen in myself and how my life's been looking up.  A couple weeks after my psychiatrist diagnosed me, i decided to take a break from my boyfriend because my mental health was jeopardizing our relationship. I was making a lot of impulsive decisions that hurt him and ended up hurting me afterwards. \n\nHonestly considering how absolutely insane I've been for the past 2 months he's a saint lol. Not only did he inspire me to quit social media (i abuse the hell out of it), but he also put me in a position where I can just focus on school and my mental health and even through this recent break, he still supported me with all of that. \n\nGetting diagnosed helped me put it into perspective, but I realized it still didn't excuse the way I treated him towards during the weeks leading up to our break.  I also got into a huge fight with my family on Christmas that made me feel like I'd lost them forever but today makes a month since my life turned completely upside down and shit's finally starting to look up again.\n\nFor one, I got the apology I never thought I would receive. In my family it's very much \"I mean what I said when I said it, but I'm sorry for the impact.\" We don't normally apologize for things we said in the heat of the moment, but we do forgive each other for how we felt. This apology was totally different. Tbh I burst into tears which shocked me because lately I feel like I can't cry. \n\nLast weekend my boyfriend came over to check on me and figure out what we're doing since we haven't really talked since New Years. I told him how sorry I was for hurting him while I was at my lowest & how much better I've been feeling lately. We ended up getting back together & nothing's really changed about us except it feels easy, like no one's waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\n I get that it's only been a little over a month since I started taking meds but I really do think that aside from the headaches my life's improved in every area. I can feel things but they're not consuming. I don't feel the need to punish myself by thinking the worst-case scenario all the time about everything and everyone. \n\nI feel like I can start a craft/project/assignment and actually see it through till the end because I stopped using social media for the most part. And most of all my support system is fucking amazing right now. my family, my best friend, and my boyfriend are all back in my life & I'm almost done with my transfer degree.\n\nI feel so much closer to living a stable life, with the career of my dreams and my loved ones by my side.\n\nI know this is a long ass post but for anyone reading it I just thought I'd share some good news!"

I asked, as I got in her face, \u201cDo you want me to hit you?\u201d\n\nIn 7 words I erased any trust that was left, took away her safety, and quite possibly ruined my marriage. I want to be clear I\u2019m not looking for vindication, I just need to share. If you want to call me a piece of shit, all deserved. \nMy wife said she will decide what to do after the birthday party on Saturday. We have a second child on the way.\n\nSince the marriage is not my choice and that is my consequence, I ask for advice on what to do. Anything. How to cope while I wait for an answer. Good anger management programs. Letting me know you\u2019ve been through or done something similar. I\u2019m at a loss and my heart is breaking, and I\u2019m looking for anything that might help me navigate my own evils and their consequences."

    "content": "I experienced a perfect storm several years ago. Murder, PTSD, unwise choice of friends, nasty break ups, struggles with autism and, icing on the cake of course- the onset of Bipolar. It ended my college education, career ambitions and friend circles in less than a year.  I didn\u2019t think it was possible to feel that level of pain from loss.\n\nMy parents helped me recover for five years. Eventually I was compelled, angrily, to get therapy. With enough sessions it became clear that chemical intervention was necessary, and after getting genetic testing I was safely placed on a prescription on a low dose. It helps me sleep and acts as a mood stabilizer. It was not a cure-all. It meant making choices without bipolar\u2019s insane drive. It's difficult to work with, but I\u2019m also at peace. I can handle more work. I even found it in me to foster a loving friendship over the past three years. That friendship has been everything to me.\n\nNot a perfect friendship mind you. Like today my friend wanted me to call her after I got home and I completely forgot. It made her feel like she's not a priority to me. Which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. In the past I would have ruminating pointlessly over the mistake, but now I find it in me to do a little better about being attentive to those things, though my progress is frustratingly slow. Getting a little better for our connection is one of the best rewards in the world and outside of those mistakes things have been wonderful.\n\nTherapy and the extremely careful administration of drugs led me from a roller-coaster ride obsessive life to the richness of real friendship. Oh and the EMDR works now. It\u2019s extremely effective at helping me work through powerful emotion and difficult memories.\n\nIf you\u2019re on the fence about medication and therapy, don\u2019t be. Find a good therapist and psychiatrist. Your life will change for the better.\n\nI hope you find your needs met this year, and good friends to boot. :)\n\nMuch love,\n\nDim Giant"

For months and months I've been complaining about extreme, constant fatigue, finding it almost impossible to get out of bed in the morning, and having so little energy that I can't complete the most basic tasks to take care of myself. I guess at first it just felt like depression, but it just kept going, even when I wasn't feeling depressed on an emotional level. I barely made any art throughout 2024, when before that I would make several pieces a month.\n\nI've just been feeling so exhausted, so empty, and constantly waiting for an upswing that just *wouldn't come*. I got checked for sleep apnea and looked into chronic fatigue syndrome trying to figure out why everything was so hard and never let up.\n\nToday something finally clicked and I started going through my journals, my now-abandoned day planners, conversations with friends, and realized this has been going on since early 2024 - when I started new mood stabilizers.\n\nNow that I've noticed it it seems really obvious. I'm pretty frustrated with myself for not piecing it together until now. It's not even like I was clinging to it for any actual benefits - I've been telling my psychiatrist I don't think it's really helping the whole time, but I guess I thought maybe it had some slight beneficial effect so I should keep taking it.\n\nSo, yeah. I think I spent most of 2024 in a numb, exhausted rut because I didn't figure this out."

I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 last year after experiencing my first manic episode and subsequent hypomania which ultimately ended up with me going to the hospital because I was not sleeping. Plus, my behavior was just generally erratic as some of us may be all too familiar with. Following the manic episode was the medication journey from hell. I won\u2019t give names as per the subreddit rules, but my meds brought stability as well as a complete apathy for life in general. I was dealing with akathisia which made working very difficult as well as trying to enjoy my time in general. \n\nI finally switched to the last med that worked best for me where I started experiencing some normal moods again and feeling like myself for the first time in 9 months. It also feels worth mentioning to me that I was being medicated for anxiety in various ways for years before my manic episode. I had not been completely free of medication for years, and it made me realize that I had no idea what it could feel like to live off of meds. \n\nSo, with the help of my psychiatrist and therapist, I safely stopped taking medication on December 31st, 2024. It is now 2 weeks in and I feel so much better. It has been a relief to experience my own personality again and just living life in a way that feels natural to me. I recognize how much of a risk it is to take by going on this path, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m making this post. It is my understanding from research that someone with bipolar 1 can live up to years without episodes occurring, not knowing when they will strike again. That\u2019s what really scares me. I recognize that, chemically, this stability I have is probably temporary and there is no way to know when an episode will strike again.\n\nI\u2019m just so new to living with this disorder and it scares me. I want to hear from you all what your experience has been and if any of what I have said resonates. I look forward to hearing from you! "

Because of my mild hallucinations and delusions the schizo prefix has been tossed around but my doctor refuses to give me a concrete answer. Am I even ill?"

    "title": "Safe and Sound Protocol with Bipolar 1?",
    "content": "Hi Reddit,\n\nMy therapist suggested the safe and sound protocol last session.  It's described as music filtered to the frequencies of the human voice only to calm the nerve system.  For me it would be specific to my anxiety and overwhelm.  I'm currently in the depression phase of bipolar 1.  I know it is used for children with autism, for example, but that would not be my use case.\n\nHere's the catch, it's through Unyte and my therapist wanted to charge $500 for access to the app.  I'm really skeptical that this filtered music is worth $500 and $500 seems like a lot of money to try a therapeutic method.  What if it does nothing?  Could i just find calm music to relax to that isn't $500?  I've combed the internet looking for a sample to test to see if it's remotely worth the money.  Unyte has their music held down pretty tightly, which is unfortunate in the sense that I'm likely go back to therapy saying that I don't have the money to try.  Still, I have some questions that feel unresolved.\n\nAlso, I cannot find anything to indicate that this method has been tested with individuals with Bipolar 1.  Could it cause me to swing back to a manic state?\n\nHere are my questions:\n1) Has anyone tried this method and felt like it was a success?\n\n2) If it was a success, did you feel like it was directly due to the company's music?\n\n3) How much of the success was learning how to sit quietly with one's thoughts and feelings and process them and the music was calming to help you do the bigger heavy lifting of learning how to relax?\n\n3.5) Could calm music or podcasts (in the frequencies of human speech) be a suitable replacement?  Maybe put a filter on your phone?\n\n4) Is anyone else skeptical of a filtered music app that costs so much and is this tightly gatekept?\n\n5) Has anyone declined when this was suggested and had success with other therapeutic methods that also involved sitting still for much less money?\n\n6) If there is a way to try before spending hundreds of dollars?\n\nDiscuss \ud83d\ude00"

I\u2019ve had episodes like this before for the past two ish years but this one was so intense and prolonged to the point where my therapist realized it wasn\u2019t just adhd lol. that\u2019s some backstory, anyway, i\u2019m struggling intensely right now with navigating romantic relationships and i really need help. I\u2019m either all consumed by a crush to the point where it drives me crazy and i\u2019m left at the mercy of UNTIL i wake up completely disgusted and bored of them. This happened to me with my first long term boyfriend, i literally one day just fell out of love with him and it was terrifying. since then, this has been a constant theme with any potential partners i have encountered. it is ruining my perception of love and myself. i feel cruel and evil and im terrified that i will never be able to commit for a long period of time with anyone because of this fear that i will just get bored or this stupid selfish idea that i can always \u201cdo better\u201d. I\u2019ve recently turned down a few guys who have genuinely been such kind, gentle, understanding (basically the whole package) dudes because i simply got bored of the attention or just wasn\u2019t able to feel what i know i am supposed to. Yes, im aware that college is all about trial and error when it comes to dating and i\u2019m aware that im most likely not going to meet my husband my freshman year lol, but this feels like a much deeper and much more terrifying experience than \u201cjust not being into them\u201d. does anyone have any experience/advice? or can anyone else relate?

I know how I feel is valid because this mental illness is a mood disorder ie I cant really control how I feel, but man do I feel shame. \n\nIt's hard for me to go through my depressive episodes without support but more than ever I feel extremely guilty for hating myself and my life and wishing it away. I get in the headspace that I shouldn't share a lick of what Im going through because it's insensitive to people with \"real problems,\" which is something I would never ever say or think about someone else who struggles with mental health and do not believe. \n\nSo obviously I know its the disorder talking when I have this guilt contrary to what I know and believe but I feel like such a pathetic loser for feeling depressed when most people could say that everything in life is going well for me in comparison. I guess that stands to validate mental illness because I am super aware and grateful for my blessings but when depressed, every waking moment feels like hell on earth and pure suffering. \n\nHopefully others going through this can share the sentiment, and know that whatever you're going through, you're not alone in it.

These sound would usually appear for a afew seconds or minutes and disappear (in the case of the alarm, every time I looked at my phone it stopped ringing but it would start ringing again after a second or two, all for a minute or 2)\n\nI'd also get some visual hallucinations like seeing people walk past in the house when empty, or vividly staring at a spider crawling up my arm and then after a few seconds swing it slowly disappear in front of me, I've also seen tall human like shadows around, and demonic figures in dark corners. I saw colours that werent there moving around like green pink and yellow beutifult colours moving around and swirling when looking at white walls, objects appeared to breathe, words moved slightly around, everything was so vivid and colorful. I'd also get this weird thing where I felt as if I were in two different situations at once, like being simultaneously lying in bed working with my laptop and being simultaneously there surrounded by the police and mg psychiatrist staring at me. \n\nAs for delusions, I've believed j was a messiah and my friends had been chosen by God t show me the path to Islam, I believed I needed t convert and follow the path to defeating the antichrist which was going to arise any moment, it gave me some weird goose bumps, the end of the world was approaching and I had to fight evil. I've believed every add was trying to show me a secrete message for a government project, they knew id find out, i felt spied on. I've felt as if I could solve everything. Everything was connected and made sense, j was sure I was some super human and that everyone else was stupid. These delusions usually slowly popped in from the beginning of an episode, usually hypomania, but only fully became a delusions half way through the episodes.\n\nI also would get this weird thing where nothing felt real and for a minute or so I couldn't understand English, it sounded different.

It seemed to help for the most part but I still didn\u2019t really notice any huge difference. Now this is where my question lies. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m actually hallucinating or if my brain is just tricking me into thinking I am. I have what I think is a hallucination nearly almost everyday wether that be a human shadow standing in a window and staring at me, or just random old fully clothed in like vintage 1800\u2019s dead people standing in a corner or sitting in a random chair, or I\u2019ll think I see my cat run past me when she\u2019s laying down on the other side of the room or not even in the room completely, or I\u2019ll see little bugs just flying around the air. \n\nBut the issues is they don\u2019t last long nothing more than a quick minute when I actually look and see nothing is there.

I know that it is not conventional and that it probably does not suit many people, but it is the choice we made and it ultimately worked for me. But it didn't work out perfectly right away and in the last 5 years everything hasn't been easy, I changed jobs 6 times, always jumping from one field to another, without consistency nor stability. I also moved 4 times. But in the last three years I really managed to stabilize myself. Two years ago I met a man with whom it was love at first sight and I got pregnant quickly, we got married. My pregnancy wasn't always easy but today I am a happily married and I love being a mother more than anything.   \n  \nAs for my professional lifeI kept my last job for 3 years but it was the black spot of my life (very stressful, demanding and making me unstable), I finally quit it for a position as philosophy teacher in high school, I only teach 4 hours and I take care of my daughter the rest of the time. I don't make a lot of money (I used to) but I don't care because it's making me so much more relax, it's worth it.   \n  \nI am also being followed by a new doctor who understands my choice and whom I see once a month, just to make sure that everything is under control. Now that I am a mother, I am really afraid of experiencing new episodes that would negatively impact my daughter's life, but tonight I think about all the chaotic situations that I have experienced and I needed to share the satisfaction of finally knowing a long period of calm."

On and off I belived they were protecting me from parinoia. 2 years ago these visuals progressed to patters on walls moving, solid serfaces breathing and belifs like these were teleportation holes opening. I was lucky to have a good friend who I could talk to and they would delecatly tell me what was real and what was not. \n\nI guess after 8 months my meds are at the right dose, and tho I deffinitly miss some of the extravagant feelings that came with hypomania, the fact that I skipped a depressive episode (which is equally as exciting! They were debilitating and sometimes down right scary) makes it worth it. \n\nSo to everyone doubting the advice of experts, or frustrated with how long it takes to figure out what works for you. It works, and youll get there. "

Proper medication and dosage not being overmedicated nor undermedicated and being flexible with what that may mean in conjunction with my doctor.\n\n3. Exercise - weight lifting, walks, Tai Chi, Yoga, Meditation (enormously helpful).\n\n4. A clean wholesome and nutritious diet.\n\n5. Getting a good night sleep every night and if I had a sleep disruption, in conjunction with my doctor using proper medication and/or herbals under my doctor's aegis to sleep well.\n\n6. Breathing techniques that are calming. Dr. Andrew Weil recommends the 4-7-8 breath that he has on his website for calming over a 2-month period. And also \"SKY\" breathing has helped me heal a bit too --- it's not a panacea but it's helpful. \n\n7. Moderation and no toxins. I avoid alcohol, and don't do any drugs. I also don't drink caffeine. I was told by a top psychopharmacologist that many people can avoid a lot of manic episodes by avoiding caffeine completely. It has helped. \n\n8. Comedy to improve the mood if a little low.\n\n9. Living life in a golden center/middle of healthy responsible moderation.\n\n10. Gratitude for the good whatever it may be. \n\nGod bless everyone. much love and peace. (love yourselves), good friends (which are \"hard to come by\" go a long way and it's been a real challenge for me to get over all the betrayals I faced due to stigma, but I'm working on it and the above helps me with that too.

It was one of the most intense episodes I\u2019ve had and forced me to tell my family about my condition, which I now see as a positive outcome. Before that, only my cousin and one close friend knew.\n\nHere\u2019s the lucid dreaming part: I\u2019ve been able to lucid dream since I was a teenager. It\u2019s not constant, but when I focus on it, I can do it. I\u2019ve heard there might be a connection between lucid dreaming and bipolar disorder, which makes sense since both started around the same time.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve started to understand why last February\u2019s episode was so intense. My usual process begins with hypomania, where I\u2019m somewhat aware of what\u2019s happening. Once I transition to mania, I lose awareness of my symptoms. This time, my coworkers pointed out traits they assumed were my personality but were actually symptoms of mania. For the first time, I realized I was in the middle of an episode while it was happening\u2014and it terrified me.\n\nIt felt like lucid dreaming in real life. In my dreams, I can influence things but not fully control them, and sometimes I lose all control. During the episode, I could see myself acting impulsively, like lying for no reason, and felt like I was in third-person, observing my actions. I was hyper-aware of my symptoms but powerless to stop them. Seeing myself this way for the first time was terrifying, especially realizing the potential destruction I could cause and knowing the lack of control I had over it. \n\nUltimately, this awareness pushed me to tell my family and seek help again. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I am trying to get out of posting this I just didn\u2019t know what to do with this information and don\u2019t really have anyone with possible familiarity to talk about it to.

    "content": "hello everyone, \n\nI was recently diagnosed with BP 1 and as many question the diagnosis, I do too. For some background I am diagnosed with PTSD & Bipolar 1. I have family members that have bipolar and it\u2019s clear when they are in an episode, but for me, most friends only notice a MAJOR difference when im depressed. It feels like the diagnosis doesn\u2019t make sense & I am planning to communicate with my psych because it\u2019s odd. \n\nI understand that bp symptoms get triggered especially with stress, and where I live we just had a major stressor due to an ongoing natural disaster and it required me to have to stay with some friends for the time being to be safe. I wasn\u2019t sleeping much for days bcuz friends let me share the room and wouldn\u2019t let me rest longer than 4-6 hours which made me start hallucinating & extremely irritable due to the lack of sleep, so I decided to return home (our warnings were removed for the area) so I finally managed to sleep 12+ hours. Frankly, I was more so worried about even returning home and I had booked a hotel just in case but it turns out that all was okay. I\u2019m confused because something like that would\u2019ve made someone manic/depressive in my opinion? \n\nFor the record, I may be overshooting here and expecting that im supposed to have an episode anytime im stressed out. Frankly ive been super stressed and emotional most of the time, it seems more PTSD related that everything is sort of blunted for me. I\u2019m dealing with more physical symptoms if anything from the stress and it got to the point I was in complete denial that any disaster was happening and started to think maybe it was all fake and the news was just making it seem like it was still ongoing (the skys are clear so I was like ??). I\u2019m not sure what to think, some things do match up to BP but I don\u2019t feel like everything does. If anyone else can relate to any of this and is diagnosed/misdiagnosed can I hear your thoughts on this??\n"

    "content": "I\u2019m having a really hard time coping with crashing into a depressive episode. I only noticed yesterday because I have never been angry at my boyfriend or gone silent. We\u2019re so gentle with each other and everything is worked out so peacefully that I felt even more loved when we disagreed or I was wrong vis versa. \n\nIt felt like a switch went off and he was the worst person alive and I left angry and convinced that he is cheating on me until he can find someone better. I don\u2019t know where this comes from but it\u2019s made me think that our entire relationship I was just manic and everything about us is a lie and I was too blind to see it before. It feels like the best decision is to cut him out of my life because I\u2019m just being used. \n\nI know if I told him this, despite the fact I\u2019ve said I ended relationships during depressive episodes and rationalize vilifying others, he would be shocked and hurt to hear this even if he\u2019s supportive. \n\nI don\u2019t want to ruin things again, I want to not believe it and that it will just end but I also can\u2019t shake the thoughts and it will eventually get worse. Eventually I will find \u201cevidence\u201d to support isolating and ending everything with anyone because they\u2019re all ruining my life and I don\u2019t need them. "

I haven't been able to find another steady job since.\n\nMy weakness is that I'm below avergae intelligence.  I mess things up, I freeze when tasked with something I don't know how to do.  I get flustered easily. \n\nI plan on reaching out to a vocational rehab place where I can disclose my bipolar depression.  \n\nI've spent 20 years in IT support, far longer than I should have.  I haven't kept up to date with my skillsets and I have trouble learning new things.  I don't know what else I can do but I plan on getting a job outside of IT for I can't handle the stress of people taking computer issues out on me. \n\nI wish there was someone on the internet that could help me find a job.  Someone I could talk to and reasonably say \"This is what I'm capable of, and this is what I'm not.\"\n\nI wish I had my peace of mind back.  My personal happiness is tied to having a steady job.  \n\nCould use some advice or helpful input if it's out there.

Pretty much everything gives me anxiety and I have built up quite the list of important tasks that I think about every single day, but don't do because I feel debilitated by stress. I am currently searching for a therapist and want to talk about anxiety meds with my psych (I literally just realized that anxiety is at the root of this), but in the meantime I'm doing as much as I can to minimize stress.\n\nMy boyfriend is so sweet and supportive of me. I've learnt to deal with the stress alone and usually don't turn to others for help, but I'm realizing he's capable and willing to help me. He even wants to. So my question is... \nDo you think it's bad if I have him email my accountant on my behalf? \n\nThis is one of my biggest stresses. I ran into some financial problems and haven't paid my 2024 taxes. I need to go on a payment plan, but just can't get myself to do it. My accountant knows I have depression and am for some reason struggling with this. He has been so kind, and followed up with me when I didn't reply to see if he can help me. But the thing is that I get motivation in spurts and if I have a problem that requires multiple back and forth emails, it's going to take me years to complete. \n\n\nCan my boyfriend just send the next email asking to schedule my appointment? I feel so childish, but I know this huge task for me would take 2 minutes for him and he is capable of following up when the accountant responds...\n\n"

Pre-COVID even. \n\nMy boyfriend and I live together and we have a very happy life together. But lately I have been angry at him and it makes it hard for feel the usual fondess I do for him. \n\nI started being angry one day about 3 weeks ago when I saw that he liked the picture of this girl we both follow on instagram, and it was nothing bad or anything but I got irrationally angry feeling like he never bothers to like my own pictures (not entirely true but what I felt ) and so I unfollowed him and removed him from my account , feeling that I\u2019ll at least feel like if he can\u2019t even see what I post, he can\u2019t ignore it by choice. But then I began to feel angry again about these photos he has of him and his ex on his page. \n\nThe shitty on my end thing is that this woman passed away suddenly at only 32. The photos are sweet many of them together and a close up of her eyes, and the caption is heart felt as fuck. In the 5 years we\u2019ve been together he has never posted me and I feel like I\u2019m overshadowed by a very important ghost. At least online. \n\nI\u2019ve brought it up, and many times the conversation gets very emotional. He has said many times before that he wanted to post us and eventually would but this was already a while ago. This time when he mentioned it I said \u201cno I don\u2019t believe you and even if you did at this point is not even because you want to but because I told you.\u201d \n\nHe says that online doesn\u2019t matter but real life does and we are doing so good , and he is right, I really really want to shake this bitter feeling I feel about our relationship with instagram as a couple. \n\nThe fact that I\u2019ve had to battle with with on and off for 5 years almost is exhausting to me. I hope that shouting it into this void can maybe help me feel heard or something. I know it isn\u2019t quite bipolar related but I and someone who has battled with bipolar and I think maybe the level of rumination I\u2019m having can be a part of it. \n\nAnyways if you\u2019re feeling that I am immature and need a talking to, please take it a little easy on me.

For example I will try respond to dysregulated sleep by enforcing rest regardless of if I can fall asleep or not (lay in a dark room for about 4 hours) or using distraction to not be in the middle of really intense difficult emotions.\n\nWhen I'm being \"disciplined\" I essentially say to myself ignore all mental symptoms and instead focus all my effort into doing the thing I want to do. This in turn makes me feel miserable and feel the brunt of my symptoms more but ultimately I feel better because I've been able to practice some autonomy instead of having to handle this disorder I got from chance. For example I will just have terrible sleep and make no attempt to calm myself down when experiencing a fit of crying and continue doing what i'm doing.\n\nAm I even describing discipline? I don't know I just be wondering where my time goes and it's usually going towards trying to make myself feel better so for the sake of self discipline I just don't let myself do anything to feel better. I have so much more time to do things in a day it just sucks more. Anyone else experience this?\n\nSorry if none of this makes sense y'all my mind is a bit foggy."

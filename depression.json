    "title": "Our most-broken and least-understood rules is \"helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort\", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",
    "content": "We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \n\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###Summary###\n\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."

    "title": "Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis",
    "content": "Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\n-----\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\n\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\n\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\n- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\n- \"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\n\n- Role modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\n\n- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\n\n- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here."

I got married at 18 and had 2 beautiful kids, but that's as far as I got with my goals. My husband didn't want to grow up and for 10 years I stayed with him waiting for him to just get his shit together for himself and our family. \n\nI left him. At first it was in hopes he would have a reality check and get his life together. But it created the opposite effect and he got involved with hard drugs. He died in 2020. I got into another relationship and stayed with him for 6 years. Again, hoping to get my happy ending. Hoping to get married, have more children and meet my goals. He cheated on me for over a year and completely shattered me. \n\nSo once again I try to hold on to hope and attempt one more time to find my partner for the last half of my life. 7 months in, I'm finding myself telling myself I'm not wasting another 6, 10 or even 1 year in another one-sided relationship. \n\nNow at 36, I feel like happiness is just not meant to be part of my story.

And my last suicide attempt was basically successful, but my boyfriend was there and he realised just soon enough that I had taken too many pills and made me purge for about 45 minutes until chunks and chunks of half dissolved pills came out. When I couldn\u2019t do it anymore all my body lost feeling and I became pale, couldn\u2019t move and could barely speak. He thinks, based off the amount I took, that he had gotten over half of them out after I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and fell to the floor. He called poison control and they told him to take me to the ER or I would die soon, and he told them he got a lot of pills out and elaborated, the man told him to take me to the ER still but that he might have bought time if not saved my life. \n\nHe carried me to the car and I think when we got there someone put me in a wheelchair. They asked me all these questions but I couldn\u2019t respond and my body was so pale I could see all my veins everywhere. I remember seeing things on my skin but it was hallucinations and I can\u2019t remember anything more from that night except that I was crying for my little brother and sad about not seeing my parents as we aren\u2019t on good terms. I passed out for hours I don\u2019t know what was done during that time but I remember the nurses thanking my boyfriend profusely for what he had done and I realised the severity of what I did. \n\nBacktrack I agreed, kind of, to not refusing the purge after he looked me in the eyes after panicking and said \u201cbabe please work with me or you\u2019re going to die. You\u2019re going to die\u201d\n\nI\u2019m a very small woman. I\u2019m 23 and my healthy weight is 98lbs I\u2019m blasian, I mostly keep to myself. The doctor told me later on when I came to, that the pills I took were the \u201cworst ones\u201d I could have overdosed on and that it\u2019s fatal for anyone to take a few, let alone someone my size and that I was lucky to be alive because my bf made me vomit most of them out otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have made it alive to the hospital most likely and if I did it would have been too late.\n\nSorry for the long post. After I understood my situation on day 2 (hospital suicide watch) I was so sad. I didn\u2019t speak much and I laid there and looked at the ceiling and the curtains and wires that were zip tied together and the door I wasn\u2019t allowed to close. I couldn\u2019t walk on my own for 3 days and when I finally could it was only for a few minutes or I\u2019d fall. My internal systems obviously took a massive hit and were seemingly put to sleep. I was sent to a facility straight from the hospital. It was either that or jail, apparently. I was told 3-5 days but was there for a week. \n\nNow, my birthday is coming up soon and my boyfriend and I butt heads a lot and we have been, on top of me feeling like dying every day and I\u2019m just so tired. I feel pathetic for failing even though I didn\u2019t technically fail, but I feel so upset and sad and I hate taking meds but I feel like maybe I should start because I just don\u2019t want to feel this way anymore.

Dont know where it originates from but i constantly think about stuff that i know will make me feel shittier. Especially when i should sleep, my brain decides, HEY LETS THINK ABOUT SOME SHIT THAT WILL MAKE YOU NOT SLEEP AND RAISE YOUR HEARTRATE BECAUSE FUCK YOU.\n\n A third of my time awake i just think about how easy it would be to just end it because its not like anyone would really care. Another third i will not be going into rn and the 3rd is just filler bs.\n\nI remove myself from social interraction just because i dont feel like i deserve it and also because acting like i dont despise the thought of myself drains so much energy.\n\nAlso i recently started ocasionally taking some old antidepressants just because i know they will make me feel like i got run over by a truck the next day (if anyone knows the yawns you get you'll understand this). \n\nTo clarify, I am not a hateful person at all. The only person i hate is myself. And to top it all off i just have to always explain everything that happens to me with some bs made up theory. For example, if someone fucks me over its MY fault because i trusted the wrong person. I have had to explain the difference between the reason for something and the blame for something to myself so many times just so i can yet again blame myself instead of something or someone else because yet agai  its all my fault. \n\nGuess im just a self destructive little shitstain\n\nIdk man its just so blehh"

    "content": "Hi all, I've been struggling with depression for most of my life, even since childhood. I've lived most of my life with quite a painful condition I'm unsure I will ever get help with and grew up in a fairly abusive and neglectful situation and sometimes I just wonder what life could have been if only things were \"normal.\" What if I was born into a family who never hurt me, what if I was born without a condition which made sure that not a moment of my life went without feeling physical pain and discomfort. It's a dreadful feeling, a feeling of hopelessness.      \n\nI like to imagine a life without these problems but when I do it only ever reminds me that such a life is something I have never known. I have never experienced a life that is \"normal.\" When I imagine a life where I can speak normally, learn normally, create the things I wish to create without being in physical pain, I feel two emotions which dance together yet are on opposite ends of the spectrum. As hopeless and broken as I feel, I also feel something burning inside me and it burns so vividly that the thought of things being better is what keeps me going through it all. When I think of what life can be, I feel like all the pain I go through will one day be only a bad memory and I will finally be happy.   \n\nBut then I'm reminded that the life I've lived, memory or not, happened and really I've had about a third of my life already taken from me. I'm only 21 and must do all I can to fight for a better life so that I'm not left miserable until the very end but man, is it a strangely miserable feeling to live a life which you know is fundamentally unfair. Whichever god had beef with me and cursed me with this fate, I wish that one day I may have my last laugh as I finally get to lead a normal, happy life. I refuse to give up."

She made me uncomfortable and i tried to express that but when i did she just started talking about how i have an attitude rather than apologizing for touching me there and tickling me. Its like how for years ive been complaining about her slapping my butt but its always \u201cim your mom i made that butt so i can do what i want\u201d THAT DOESNT MEAN IM COMFORTABLE WITH YOU TOUCHING ME THERE?!\n\nI heard her talking to rome and calling herself a failure, so i texted her \u201cYoure not a failure as a parent bc i dont like tickling? You didnt kill someone so pls dont think you did something terrible im just not comfortable with tickling and ik it can get annoying to remind me to stop having an attitude but like i wasnt even trying? I was busy drawing and had you kiss me on the forehead and i didnt mean to seem rude. Youre obviously upset so were gonna talk abt this in therapy when we have an in person session\u201d\n\nAnytime i tell her something she did that upset me she talks about stuff i do that upsets her before even apologizing and then says she feels like a failure. Weve been in family therapy for so long and i feel like anytime we make progress we go back 10 steps because of some stupid fight! Im so tired of living with her and if things dont change im just gonna need her out of my life bc i cant handle the fights and negativity that i legit only have around her \u201coh you have attitude\u201d SO HOW COME I DONT BE FIGHTING LIKE THIS WITH ANYONE ELSE?!\nI may have an attitude but she yells, she throws stuff (like when i burned chocolate and she threw the microwave cover on the counter), she makes assumptions (like when she assumed i think shes stupid simply because i tried to melt chocolate on my own rather than asking for her help), and shes slapped me right infront of our family! So if this stuff keeps happening im moving out the second i can and im never coming back.\n\nIve tried avoiding her a bit lately because ive leanred even when shes coming to say goodnight or telling me something rlly quickly for only a few minutes we fight again. I cant be around her for just 5 minutes or either of us gets upset.\n\nAnd i cant believe my own mother would be the  reason im crying and writing all this rn wishing there was somewhere i could go where id just never have to see her and worry about being around her again.

I've been on every SSRI, SNRI, and a couple of atypical meds. I'm currently on Lexapro, which is keeping me from rotting in bed, but it does nothing to ease the feeling of hopelessness or the negative self-talk. Until I find a regimen that gives me more energy and mood stability, my therapist doesn't think talk therapy will have any effect. The last combination meds they tried had awful side effects, so now it's on to TMS. Of course, now my depression has me second-guessing that, like it's just another option doomed to fail. \n\nI don't share any of my feelings with my family. I don't want to dump, my problems on them, especially not my mom. She'd just be upset and insist I move home with her, because in her mind that'll fix everything. I'm 35 years old and pretty isolated. I have one close friend and live at least 30 miles from my nearest relatives. \n\nI'm just so damn tired all the time.

I\u2019m overwhelmed by how much I want to change, but I feel like I\u2019m dragging this invisible weight behind me.\n\nGrowing up, my parents were strict, especially my father. He was often critical, calling me names like \u2018lazy\u2019 or \u2018useless.\u2019 I rarely felt like I was good enough. My mother wasn\u2019t very involved, and I didn\u2019t have much emotional support. I struggled in school and felt like I could never measure up. Even now, I hear those voices in my head when I try to push myself to do something.\n\nI think a lot of my procrastination comes from fear\u2014fear of failure, fear of not being good enough, fear of proving that voice in my head right. I get paralyzed and avoid things that matter to me, even though I know it\u2019s hurting me. I also struggle with self-discipline because part of me just wants to avoid discomfort, even if it means I stay stuck.\n\nI want to be consistent.

I would say that we know each other very well and have a good grasp on how to help or even just provide support to each other during hard times. For a while now, my boyfriend has been depressed and is constantly up and down with his emotions (I hope that doesn't come off as rude). I hate to see him hurting and appreciate when he is vulnerable with me, which isn't often because he still struggles with the whole idea that men can hurt too and it doesn't make them less manly to express those feelings. I myself have had depression for a while (I have been doing good for the past few months), but my experience and what I need is very different than his. Just to put this out there, he never directs any of his pent up aggression or hurt feelings at me. Every time I can feel him having a depressive episode (his tone and demeanor changes) I make sure to give him a bit of space, but I eventually ask if hes upset, if hes okay, and if he wants to talk about it. Almost everytime he does, and he says around the same thing; \"I am always depressed, anxious and everything feels horrible. Nothing makes me feel better. I just want to sleep.\" I am very concerned about him, and yes hes seeing professional help and has shown some improvement. I just don't know what to say. I know it isn't on me to fix his problems, but what can I do? I hate to see him suffering. I don't want to pry too much because he might become quiet and repetitive (usually this means hes checked out) but I don't want to be leaving it alone in fear that I wasn't there when he needed me. What should I do? What should I say?"

I feel nothing still. I know I suffer from a depressive disorder, but the medication doesn't help. As for my early life I was left by my mother to live with my dad who works constantly, I was eventually raped by my mother as well, so I have no real connection with either parent and was never really raised. And I cannot form any kind of romantic/platonic relationship that can last for more than a couple months. This is just for a basic understanding of my background.\n\nI feel as if a lot of the reasons why I am so lonely, and therefore miserable, is my fault. Because of the fact I never tried to come out of my shell when I was younger and how I am a terrible compulsive liar and it ends up harming my relationships with everyone. I am very isolated and it hurts my soul.\n\nBecause of this, and a tainted past of smoking and amphetamines I have decided that I am not worth living for. I have read the Bible and I pray every night to God, and I still do believe in him but I ask him often to take me in my sleep. I am sick and tired of my life, I feel nothing anymore except for animalistic desire. But I don't want to upset God, maybe someone here would be upset but I am Gods child as well.\n\n\n\nI know this is kind of a mess but ask questions if you read through this. "

The pain of his loss is still fresh enough our minds that if I did commit suicide, I don\u2019t know what would happen to the mental state of my family.\n\nMe? I have no one. I am a disappointment to my family. All the colours in my life have faded to gray. I have nothing to live for. Every night I pray I go out in my sleep so the pain of a loved one committing suicide doesn\u2019t affect my family. I consider jumping in front a bus or a skytrain everyday on the way to work.

But after few days of bed rotting some of my friends or family urge me to do these anti depression techniques like sports, walks, being social etc.. And it works! For a few days I become optimistic that I can b  beeat this shit and make plan about my recovery. But after few days of this coping and having and optimistic mindset, everything usually goes to shit and I am back in my everyday apathy and mild depression. I just cannot carry on anymore.\n\nThis circle makes a full turn every few months. And it\u2019s so tiring.

The small group of friends I used to have have moved on with their lives, started careers and started families. They don't talk to me anymore. Wasn't even invited to their weddings. I've been forgotten. Both my brothers sexually abused me as a child and my parents would rather just brush it under the rug than deal with it. I love my parents but I can't even go to their house (my childhood home) because my brother lives there with no signs of moving out. I have a wife and I love her but our marriage has been falling apart for years now. I'm a shell of who I used to be. I don't do any of the things that I enjoy doing anymore. Why? I don't know I just don't. Instead I just spend my time sleeping, eating and staring at my phone screen for hours at a time. I've gained 40+ lbs in the last couple of years because I switched from coping with drugs to coping with food. I've always been insecure about my appearance but now it's exponentially worse as I have grown what looks like a beer belly. Clothes don't fit anymore and I've gone from a medium to an extra large. XXL coming soon. I still do the drugs they just don't do it for me all the way anymore. I've tried sobriety but I can't bear facing the world without a crutch. The only way I see to end the suffering is to end my life. It will probably hurt a few people pretty badly but they will get over it and move on with their lives. I'm scared and I don't know if I will be able to go through with it but I am desperate to leave my cursed mind behind. Sorry I just wanted to rant I don't know what the point of this is. "

    "content": "TLDR: I have been lucky throughout my academic life. But I have never had any truly lasting friendships and think I am insignificant in everyone's lives. All of it is crashing down on me right now.\n\nI am dumping my thoughts without editing for clarity or word length. This has been a recurring feeling throughout my life, but the last couple of months have made it measurably worse.\n\nI come from a fairly middle-class family. My parents have been the best parents I could've asked for and provided me with all that I could've ever asked for throughout my childhood despite their means. They have also supported me \u2014 financially and otherwise \u2014 throughout my school and undergrad education and never asked for anything from my side. My sister is the cutest and most loving little girl. So, my family doesn't have anything to do with this rigmarole I'm typing.\n\nI (somehow) got into one of the best colleges in my country and a major that I liked (but not my natural first choice). To this day, I consider it a fluke (Fluke #1). My academic performance throughout the course was okay at best. I'd always wanted to transition to another major (the one I didn't get to do in my undergrad) and liked research, so I applied to graduate programs. I was terribly unconfident with my chances, as I was coming from a major with minimal overlap, and while I did have a relevant internship, nothing else in my resume could be considered \"good\" for a graduate applicant. As expected, most of the decisions I got back were rejections. Just when I'd given up hope, I (somehow, again) got and accepted an offer from one of the best colleges in the world for this major. This was Fluke #2.\n\nAll this to say, my academic life has been a set of flukes. I do realize this statement comes off as me taking it all for granted, but I am not. I'm very grateful for the opportunities I've been given. It's just that, because of all this, I have had imposter syndrome on steroids for the last 6-odd years. And I cannot let it go.\n\nMoving along. I have always been an introverted person. In my childhood, I moved around quite a bit, so I never lived in the same city for too long. As a result, I couldn't make any close friends. I was considered an \"outsider\" at every school I went to despite trying my best to fit in, as I would always be associated with being from another part of my country. I did make a few friends here and there, none of them close, but I am not in touch with any of them anymore. During my undergrad, I was \"adopted by\" some friends who I am still in touch with (kinda), but all of us have diverged in our paths. Most of them are still in my country, so they meet and hang out with each other even now while I am continents away. I feel (and believe with good reason) that they are closer to each other and other people than they are to me. It's valid, given the distance and the fact that I am not very outgoing. I don't think too much of it.\n\nI have made friends in grad school as well, and they have been some of the most enriching friendships that I have had. By trying to be more outgoing, I connected with a lot more people and made friends with a good number of them. While I do consider a few of them close, I still feel nobody would think of me as a close friend. My roommate is the best roommate I could've asked for, and to me, they are as close to family as it gets here. But I am not sure they would feel the same about me. And now, most of these people will be moving to other places, so I fear these friendships will end up like the ones I made during my undergrad.\n\nSo, really, I think I am a bystander in all of my friends' lives, despite all of them being main characters in my life. I make efforts to interact with all of them to the best of my (introverted) capacity, but ultimately, my life has been a recurring series of people entering, me getting close to them, and them leaving... While I still remain attached to them.\n\nI've never been a goal-oriented person, nor have I had any thoughts about how I want my future to pan out, for a long time. The last time was when I was sure about the field I wanted to work in. I see my friends, and everyone has dreams for the future and has things \"sorted\" for themselves, in the short-term if not long-term. I feel really happy for them all, but resent them at the same time, because I don't see myself going anywhere.\n\nUntil now, I used to \"latch onto\" a few people. During my childhood, it was family. During my undergrad, it was my family and those few friends. In grad school, it has been my roommate and my other new friends. But now that I know for a fact I won't have any of those around me in my short-term future, I have stopped living for myself. I have lost all motivation to do anything. I never want to work on my academics. I have stopped stepping foot outside my room and skip food very frequently. I really don't know if I will be able to survive for much longer like this.\n\nI have considered ending it a few times. I thought I was in worse mental shape at this time last year, but I have (somehow) dug myself \u2014 and fallen into \u2014 a deeper hole. This has been the story every passing year, and I have gotten tired of it. I think this is all too much to bear any longer. It feels like that would be alright because nobody apart from my family really considers me a significant part of their lives. Plus, what am I really doing in life besides just existing?\n\nI know I am only 25 and \"my life is only getting started\" and I have a shit ton more to see and experience. I know I need therapy. I cannot bring myself to go. I have hobbies, but I don't feel like doing them anymore. None of them are ones where I have to interact with people. I am in touch with my family."

I feel like I\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m drowning, and it seems like there\u2019s no way out. My family\u2019s in a rough spot financially, and I\u2019ve been living in a one-bedroom apartment for about 5 years now, sleeping in the living room. I\u2019m 18, and I\u2019ve been helping my mom with a lot since I was 10, but it feels like I\u2019m doing more than I should be. She\u2019s not very educated, and her English is poor, so she can\u2019t handle a lot of things on her own, including business-related stuff. It's just hurts even more and makes me really sad :( because I know she\u2019s trying her best but she\u2019s just not doing things the right way and it\u2019s hard to watch.)\n\n^(We\u2019re always living paycheck to paycheck. I work too, but my income barely covers anything, and I don\u2019t think it would even be enough if I lived by myself. I make maybe around a thousand or less a month, but a lot of the time I end up having to help her with things she can\u2019t pay for, like bills and other expenses. I\u2019ve been planning to move out for a while, but things always get in the way, and I feel like I\u2019m stuck back at square one. It feels like I\u2019m running away from my problems, but I just wish to live comfortably. I don\u2019t want to be stuck because of things I didn\u2019t cause.)\n\n^(This year, for the first time, I\u2019m the one doing my mom\u2019s taxes. She\u2019s always had a CPA before, but now it\u2019s all on me. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, and it feels like a huge burden.

I mess up a lot\u2014like I\u2019m lazy, I make mistakes constantly, and it\u2019s like I can\u2019t get things right. I\u2019m terrible at school, video games, socializing, basically everything. I feel like a failure. I even went through a really depressive episode in 2023 after reading Oyasumi Punpun the ending had me up fucked up and seeing how Aiko was treated in the end made me feel like I wasn\u2019t alone in my sadness. It\u2019s a tiny bit better now, but I still struggle.)\n\n^(I don\u2019t have much of a father figure. My dad\u2019s far away, and honestly, he\u2019s not someone I can rely on. He\u2019s also the reason I\u2019ve had some pretty terrible experiences in my life. Another thing to add his father sexually assaulted me when I was 14/5ish and that just made everything even more worse. I\u2019ve always felt like the odd one out in school maybe I\u2019m autistic, maybe I have ADHD, but I don\u2019t really know. I\u2019m just lost in it all.)\n\n^(I know I\u2019m not perfect, and I\u2019m trying, but it feels like it\u2019s never enough. I want to move forward, but I don\u2019t know how. I have goals, like I want to make a change in the world somehow and I want to have a future with my girlfriend, but it\u2019s hard to see the path forward when everything is so overwhelming. Sometimes I wish I had some sort of father figure or someone to guide me.)\n\n^(I\u2019m just feeling really stuck, and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.

Every single men I\u2019ve met have donde something like this. Maybe I\u2019m note enough, maybe I\u2019m not worth to be taken care. I think he actually have good feeling for me, but it so confusing sometimes. \n \nWe study a medical career in which you have to do get patients. I let him practice on me in something that is not that serious but you need to have days off, I thought that he will take me to home but then he told me if it was better for me to go with my parents and that just fucking broke me. Probable im being dramatic, but I did everything for him to practice on me, but he didn\u2019t take me to home. What if he doesn\u2019t love me? He had time. He had plenty of time. And now I do believe small things matter. Or I\u2019m overreacting? \n\nI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m pissed off. I really tried to do everything I could to be a good girlfriend. I tried everything. \n\nBUT THE THING THAT FUCKING DISGUSTED ME THE MOST IS WHY DO I HAVE TO CARE SO MUCH ABOUT MY LOVE LIFE. \n\nWTF is wrong with me. I\u2019m tired I\u2019m fucking tired o people. I\u2019m depressed, not because of this things, I\u2019m fucking tired of being me, of feeling trapped in my body, I just want to stop thinking, it would be better if I just shut my thoughts.\n\nI feel I hate everyone but mostly I hate me. I fucking hate myself I\u2019m just to fucking tired of waking up every single day. \n\nI feel so angry with me, with myself, with everyone around me. Fuck fuck fuck this. I\u2019m just a bad person, because with my family I\u2019m always mad, I don\u2019t want to be around them, but with others I always soft and sweet, like if I\u2019m always fake. I should just kill myself."

I went out for a walk and wandered the streets till i reached an empty yet suspicious street and it was 3 AM. I found a place like a small shop but abandoned and without a door, There was a table and some broken glass. At that time, I was 15 years old and I was doing self harm so I grabbed a piece of glass and stood behind the table and started cutting my arm.  And I didn't see anyone at that time i thought i was totally alone. After I did this stupid thing, I sat under the table crying my eyes out. After a while I stood up and started walking again.\n\n\n What i didn't know of is that there was someone who saw me harming myself and thought that I was taking a drug injection because it was really dark and drug injections r a thing in Egypt and that guy called his friends. I was confused at the time and didn't understand anything. They pinned me down, kept insulting me and making fun of me and asking me what were u hitting? u son of a bitch. I was frozen and helpless and of course I stayed silent. I wouldn't tell them I was cutting myself with a piece of glass, but I told them that it wasn't an injection. They stole my Airpods and wanted to steal my money but I didn't have any money, and there was still blood on my T-shirt, but it was dark and none of them saw it because I covered it.\n\n I ran home and fell asleep trying to forget the shit that js happened. It was very late and everyone in my family was already asleep and no one asked abt me... Btw i stopped self harming so no worries "

But getting older is realizing that sometimes life circumstances are just the way they are and made you the way you are, i hate to play victim and up until now i had hoped that my \u201cdepression\u201d and \u201canxiety\u201d were just puberty. they sadly weren\u2019t i\u2019m getting help now but i\u2019m seriously reaching my limit. during highschool i got really depressed, into drugs, tried to end it all. i was just overall dead inside. i managed to graduate yay, went to college dropped out because i got really depressed and i wasn\u2019t passionate about what i was learning. (it\u2019s not like i wasn\u2019t doing the work because i was and i could have passed but my heart wasn\u2019t in it) so yeah i took a gap year, worked, tried to figure shit out like what i want to do, tried different hobbies, it was like one of the loneliest year of my life. but i was very disciplined in everything that i did. this year is my 3 year mark of going to the gym and before that i excersized 2 years at home so yeah that\u2019s the only thing that has been keeping me going and alive, i have a back injury now not sure why maybe because of the stress and depression but could be because of improper form? anyways if i end up not being able to go to the gym i just might aswell not be here, it truly has been the only thing that has been helping me with my depression, loneliness and anxiety. even if i did not want to i went, even though i was tired i went. i quit work a month ago, i want to change work because i want to broaden my cv etc, but fuck it feels wrong not to go to work, i used the time to focus on passing my drivers license which i did. i should be happy because on the outside everything seems okay, i found what i want to do with my life, i love graphic design, i stay active, passed my drivers license, i work, set goals for the year ykno like a mood board, i\u2019m on the student council, but fuck do i feel lonely, it\u2019s eating me alive. i might be traumatized by my past relationship which doesn\u2019t hel, everything is a lot and i\u2019m so tired of thinking about it all. when is it my time to be alive? i just don\u2019t understand why i can\u2019t have the strength to keep on going. why can\u2019t i be normal? why am i never good enough, why do i always try my hardest and nothing good comes out of it? i just get more and more depressed. why can\u2019t i be the type of person to instead of drown in their sorrow find light and become a stronger person from it. why am i such a fucking failure. i\u2019m a bad friend i lost so many of them. because i just did not feel connected to them. even now at school i feel lonely, do i choose to feel this way? but why would i. so many questions. i know this all is written all messy but i can\u2019t think, i can\u2019t sleep. i can\u2019t function properly. i have no one that i can truly talk to except my therapist. so fuck it why not write anonymously to a bunch of strangers. goodnight."

I rather be in hellfire and see nothing in darkness than just live like this another single day. I have no wife, no children, no family, no career, no goals, no property.

I do have good memories with my parents but I honestly have more bad then good, my memory isn\u2019t the best as others around me. My brother and I were kicked out a lot as teens by our parents & the family moved a lot because my parents were unhappy where we were. I worry a lot that I picked up bad habits/traits from my parents.\nI definitely have some trauma. \n\nI have known my girlfriend for over 10 years now, she seen me up and down, & is always supportive and so are my siblings. But I do not want to keep being a burden to them that I feel I am ( they say I\u2019m not)\n\nI\u2019ve reached out to people in my life asking them if they think I\u2019m a narcissist, they all said no, ( I wonder myself  if I do that just for validation) I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m easy manipulated, too hard on myself, that I might be codependent, that I tend to over share like now & that I just have bad anxiety which gives me relief in the moment but after those feelings leaves I can\u2019t help but resort back to my worry that something is wrong with me. I just feel so different than everyone around me, I constantly need reassurance, I think I\u2019m always doing the wrong thing and apologize all the time but even then I feel as if that\u2019s a selfish act. I feel selfish because I can\u2019t stop thinking about what is wrong with me rather than be in the moment with my family ( at times I feel fake and the world around me is so foreign) I worry that I\u2019m subconsciously manipulating those around me & that they know I\u2019m this terrible person inside but they just put up with me. I just can\u2019t stop it or snap out of this. I question if I feel real love which drives me insane\u2026\n\nI feel as if something is wrong with my cognitive ability, i have a hard to focusing on things,I don\u2019t seem to think deeply about things the way others do, others around me don\u2019t need constant reassurance, they have their own interests, they are confident and happy. I have been getting frustrated very easily lately and that makes me feel even worse like why can\u2019t I handle things better like other people. I get to the point of frustration I hit my head and punch pillows because I\u2019m so upset that I can\u2019t fix myself/ my brain to stop this behavior. Ive been doing this extensive reading about mental disorders pretty much none stop for weeks now because I just need answers as to why I am this way.. \n\nYears ago I felt this exact same way, I felt that I could be ocd, have npd or bpd, or autistic or have adhd, the list goes on. I started working again and working out at that time and for awhile I felt I over came who I was before in a way but now all of those same worries and feeling are the same ones I have today. I started working out again but I feel  by doing that I\u2019m just escaping my internal issues.\nI don\u2019t want to do anything, I have no motivation besides to hide myself in my bed so I can stop hurting people and just read till I figure it out but I can\u2019t I\u2019m a father now which is bringing me more stress because I don\u2019t want to be a bad influence on my son. \n\nI get very paranoid that all interactions have something to do with me and a sign that is somehow correlated with what I\u2019m doing wrong/ everyone knows I\u2019m messed up and are low key comparing me to bad behaviors of others. When people come to me to vent or advice I feel like it\u2019s a test and I hesitate to give advice because I don\u2019t want to manipulate subconsciously. I used to think my parents were narcissists and maybe my brother but I worry that I was just projecting my own insecurities and still do that a lot. I definitely have trust issues, I\u2019m scared to be intimate at times with my gf of ten years out of fears that I\u2019m not reading her emotions right & I don\u2019t want to be rejected..\n\nI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m posting this on the web, I guess I just want to see if others have been through this same journey & what it took to get better, & a part of me wants to just be heard.\n\nThank you anyone has taken the time to read this, any insight and advice will be appreciated. I\u2019m sure there are many typos and it may be hard to follow along. I\u2019ve been having a hard time focusing lol  I just want to be normal & I want to be able to feel like I can love properly.."

    "content": "Hey, this is my first time writing on the thread. So bare with me if I'm horrible at explaining. It's long but I hope you guys can give me some advice.\n\n*Background story: (you can skip this part)*\n\n*Long story short, I have been with my high school sweetheart for 4 years now. We broke up once in between because we were immature and reconnected when we both realized we love each other so very much. We seemed to fix the issues we had, so it was very good.*\n\n*The problem happened when we were about to go into long distance because my job relocated to a different state; and I found out he cheated on me 2 months (from when i found out) ago. We had to go into long distance with this news. We had a couple issues from him lying to me before but nothing this big. He flew in and begged and explained everything to me and told me he would do everything to fix it.*\n\n*First month was good, but he started to get really frustrated with the guilt and not noticing any improvement on my end (although he fully understood it was his fault at the end of the day). He cheated on me at work, so every time he is at work I would freak out, fairly so, but still very frustrating situation for both of the party. Plus he was dealing with a lot of guilt (again reasonably so, but painful). He started to mention that this maybe isn't something he can't fix and he fucked up. He was losing hope. On my end, I was basically having anxiety attacks everything he didn't answer the phone, and every time we called, I would just get really upset\u2014obviously I was taking my time accepting and healing.*\n\nHere is my question:\n\nAfter cheating on me, my boyfriend has been repeatedly saying that he doesn't deserve me, he feels more and more guilty every day, he feels like he's walking on eggshells because he doesn't want to hurt my feelings, he feels like even when he is not trying to hurt my feelings he keeps hurting me and that makes him feel horrible. He mentions his relationship with his parents isn't great (when he respects his parents the most) and that his father keeps telling him something is wrong with him. He doesn't feel like himself and he hates himself. He hates who he has become. Then starting a month ago, he said he doesn't feel anything.\n\nHe first thought he was losing feelings for me, but he realized that he was feeling the same way towards his mother who he loves the most and his father. He said something is wrong with him and he wants to understand why he is feeling this way. With all the feeling of emptiness and hatred for himself, he doesn't feel it when I even tell him I love him. He just feels like he doesn't deserve someone like me. He knows that he loves me in his head, but he doesn't feel it and therefore it is so hard for him to be affectionate towards me when he knows that is what I need. He said he has tried everything to get rid of this thought but he couldn't and started to feel like breaking up is an option worth trying as nothing else seems to work.\n\nThat being said, he asked to break up, because he needs some time alone to fix it. He always have been someone that doesn't think he needs anyone, and so he just wants to deal with this himself. He fears that he would hurt me even more if I'm around, and eventually ruin the love I have for him. He doesn't believe in therapy but he finally decided to get it (which shows how desperate he is) to have someone to talk about this. He assured me he still loves me so much and he cares about me more than anything\u2014he just needs to deal with it himself and hopefully he can come back. It was hard because he couldn't seem to pull the trigger himself, we took days to separate for real and I finally decided to walk away for now because I believed I should do it for him. Even until the last moment, it was clear he didn't want me out of his life.\n\n**Did I do the right thing? Would he come back? What if he just lost feelings for me? I am sure he has depression, is this what he really needs?** Should I keep trying to show my support and love? I just don't know what is the best thing for him in this situation and I just want to understand better what he needs.\n\nThanks, this is really damn long but I'd really appreciate your response."

I'm desperate. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety since my teen years. I took antidepressants for almost four years, alongside some private therapy sessions, although these were not enough because I could not afford more. However, the medication did not help at all, so I gradually stopped taking it months ago (gradually).\n\nEverything got worse when I started feeling pain almost everyday and got diagnosed with fybromialgia, for which they prescribed me opioids. Again, they do not seem to work well for me, since the pain won't go away. I had to stop working and studying because of this. Last September, I enrolled again on uni in order to try to finish my undergraduate degree. I did my best to attend most lessons, mostly because attendance was compulsory. I was not in that much pain, but since beginning of December, I have been feeling worse and worse.  \n\nI am in dark place right now. I barely can keep with hygiene, cannot cook (if it wasn't for my sister, I would have starved), cannot concentrate to study, don't see my friends (if I can call them that...), etc. Honestly, I feel like a burden and a complete failure. Even if my chronic illness is not a degenerative one, it affects me tremendously in all aspects of my life. If I am not able to work and the state won't give me financial aids, how am I supposed to pay for the most basic things? My parents won't be always there to help me. My father is almost 70 and my mother is ill too, she has a stage 4 lynfoma cancer and is currently receiving radiotherapy (she is stable tho and has overcome it for seven years now). Also, besides these circumstances, I hate being so dependant on them and our relationship has been problematic since my teen years too. \n\nI just don't see the point of living and I have not tried to end my life because of two things: I am afraid of failing and of the consequences it would have and because of how my death would affect my family and the people around me in general. \n\nThank you for reading this.

    "title": "I feel like I've lost everything in the matter of a week",
    "content": "Posting this on an alt, for many people that know me personally have access to my main.\n\n  \nI have been struggling with what I would call depression and anxiety my entire life. Since some traumatic events that happened more than 5 years ago, I've never been the same. It's not that I didnt find some happiness. I had very good moments in this meantime. But the general average is that it sucks. Nothing felt as good as it should, and I can count on my fingers the moments where I felt true, serene happiness.  \n\nAfter a lot of struggle, I managed to make my life stable. To atleast have things to hold on to. I started having perspective. I made friends, and of these friends, I started dating a girl in my last year of high school. It started casual, but then became serious. Besides the normal issues with any relationship, we loved eachother. We stood for eachother. We helped eachother. She was with me at my lowest, and I was with her at her lowest. \n\nBefore we started dating, I was skeptical of everything, battle-hardened by many struggles before. I opened up. We even started making plans together, even though I had promised myself to never promise anything truly serious to anyone before I could fullfill such promises. She started to say we would be together forever. That we would grow old together. And I bought that, and I replied the same things. \n\nShe got into university, I started to study to get into one (the course I want to get into is one of the hardest in my country). Two years went by. Until our relationship started to decline at the last two or so months. We became quite distant. Until last week, she stopped calling me \"love\". And then, yesterday, she broke up with me.\n\nI want to make it clear I wasnt caught by surprise by this. I knew this was going to happen. I went ready for that. I didnt try to negotiate, I didnt protest. I merely accepted it with a low head, and we reminisced the good times we had together. She said she wasnt ready for such a serious relationship. She wanted to reconsider her life choices. And I agreed. Not a tear fell down my eye.\n\nMy mental state was also never the best for such a compromise either. And I've accepted I wont get better so soon, with all the stressing study time I need to undergo.\n\n Our relationship was good, but it had its problems too. I suffered always in silence, even though I always would give her emotional help whenever she needed it. And now I realize, she never corresponded to me in the same way I did to her. \n\nEven then, a immense pain attacks my chest. I already miss her. Part of me stoically accepts she was never mine, and I was never hers, and thus I must accept nature and let it go. But another part of me reminds me of all the plans we had, of all the lovely dates and all the lovely words. This part makes me feel like this was wrong and unfair. Like something that goes against the rules of nature itself. \n\nWorst of all, I've got no friends to help me go through this all and distract myself. I was so dependent of her that I never had an actual friend group of my own. And there goes all my friends. \n\nAll of this during this extremely stressfull period of trying to get into a university and make something out of me fucking life. I discovered this same week I wouldnt be getting into tertiary education this year. \n\nI feel like I've lost everything, like every door has closed for me. I lost the person I most loved in my life. And I actually mean it. I cried today, a lot. I keep praying, and praying, and praying, hoping God will show me good in life, that he will hear my anguish and reach out. Because, right now, my temptation to just kill myself is big."

Compliment people, engage in whimsy, I have hobbies and things.\n\nThe reason I do all of this is because I got told that if I acted happy I\u2019d be happy, and for the most part, I don\u2019t really want to jump in front of trains anymore.

I walk with a pep in my step, I always make an effort to wash myself and wash my clothes because when it got bad I physically couldn\u2019t and I just don\u2019t want people to know how bad it gets sometimes.

Yeah , that's probably a very common human experience. Difference is, I feel neutral persistently. I don't ever feel sad or happy. Just nothing. \n\nI feel like I don't really have that much control over my life. I go to school, go home, spend the whole day doing almost nothing and go to sleep. I guess I'd like to live, though I don't really know how to life different than that. I've been living like this for a long time now. I honestly feel like days, weeks and months are passing by without any meaning. It doesn't really bother me though, I don't have strong feelings towards it or anything. \n\nMy deepest desire is to talk to someone who'd understand me. Though, there is no one. I have friends and family but I neither can open up, not has one of them done trough something similar. I just want someone to hug me, tell me that eventually there will be genuine happiness for me and that everything will be okay and that they love me and that I'll just have to persist and... well I'm fantasising again. I btw do that a lot. I basically live rent free in my own head. \n\nI don't feel anything in the small happy things anymore either. Playing video games? Stopped that because it felt too meaningless. Food? I only eat what's there and what I'm used to. Literally all my food always tastes the same and I'm content with it most of the time. Hobbies? I have two, reading and writing. Both of them feel like work to me though. I'm like \"I have to do something meaningful today\" and since these two things are the only things that seem meaningful to me that I can do (except praying), I stress about them. When I do them though, they are the only things that give me a little Joy. And yeah, all other things that'd make one feel joy I either don't have or Don't make me feel Joy. I've never fallen in love since i was 8, have almost no desire for anything (I don't know if I'm just aroace or not able to feel these things because of my human condition, besides i just dont desire anything really) and don't really pursue anything in my current state of life. \nI wish I could live through the basic teen experiences, but I can't. \n\nI don't feel to have any meaningful relationships. Those I have feel superficial and a bit hollow, those that are somewhat intimate, I can't open up to those people. I happen to feel lonely sometimes, though most of the time I'm glad to have so little to do with people besides school. I'm extremely introverted, as one might have ready been able to tell. \n\nCan't think of anything else. \nReminder: I don't ever feel sad, or down, or depressed, or grieving, or pressured, or hollow or anything like that. I just feel nothing. Thus, my 3 moods are basically neutral, socially performing and rarely angry. Yeah, the only strong emotion I rarely feel is anger. \n\nI don't feel like writing any more though there are like a gazillion things I could write. \n\nIs that depression? Probably not, though it might not seem like it I'm actually very content with my life. Not fulfilled or satisfied or happy, but content. I've been living like this for a long time. So, I kinda got used to it. I have pretty much given up hope that life will become great and accepted that its just okay. So, if there is no cure to that, it wouldn't pressure or shock me. This actually seems like what life for most people most of the time gotta be like. \n\n\n\n"

My family discovered this, and my mother took me home without saying much. She consulted a friend, who advised her to take action to ensure I would never do it again. My mother heated a knife over a fire and pressed it against my hand. To this day, I have a scar from that incident, and whenever I see it, I am reminded of the abuse.\n\nMy childhood was deeply traumatic. As I grew older, I struggled immensely with my sexuality. For years, I believed that the abuse was the reason for my homosexuality. This internal conflict caused me significant pain and confusion. Over time, however, I reached a point where I began to accept and embrace my sexuality.\n\nI experienced severe depression, especially during my time at university. In high school, I had good grades, but everything changed when I started university. I\u2019m not sure exactly what happened, but I lost all motivation to study or improve my life. Despite this, I managed to pass my courses and even started a job. Throughout this time, I was constantly battling mental health struggles (I think I have ADHD as well)\n\nThis year, I received devastating news: I was diagnosed with HIV. This was completely unexpected and has been incredibly difficult to process.

Fast forward to Sunday I'm home alone all day and I start feeling thoughts like I didn't want to be here any more. I'm tired, burned out, haven't slept since Wednesday night by this point. I'm extremely emotional all day crying my eyes out by myself. I catch myself on just before everyone else comes home from work or whatever else they were doing. fast forward to today I started making active plans for ending my life in my head. I told my mental health practitioner about this, I told her it's just thoughts not an actual action plan that I'd never kill myself because death scares me and it opens up a whole can of worms. she tells me to wait in her room while she makes a few phone calls. She rang my dad and sister and told them that I was planning to kill myself even though it was just thoughts and that killing myself is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. I would never in a million years kill myself because death is the number one thing that scares me most but I have always been curious about what it's like to die and be dead. again death scares me especially because I don't know what is beyond life is it lights out total darkness or do we have an afterlife. anyways I get home and my dad and sister give me the worst talking to in my life. feeling worse than ever right now wish I never opened my mouth about how I truly feel. Lesson learned I won't be sharing how I truly feel again and NO this isn't a troll post. it legit happened to me today. My sister and dad are extremely angry with me right now. I don't know if they will ever forgive me. just a little bit of a background I come from a very strict catholic family."

(without highschool I can not even get a job as a cashier in my country).\n\nAlso if I drop out of this course that it was 3 years, I will lose the whole year and a half that I went to classes, so if I want to finish high school in the future, it will be 3 years again (I also saw other option that I could finish highschool in 1 year and a half, online but I will have to pay)\n\n\nI don't know how to become a adult, clearly I still act like a child without responsibilities, I don't want to blame depression because there is a lot of people with depression that are strong enough to do everything in their daily life's but going to school gives me suicidal thoughts and I already tried this before, failed and went to a psych ward.\n\nmy mom said she is okay with me not studying/working for a year and getting my mind in the right place but I'm pretty sure this one year can quickly turn into 10 and when I realize I'm 30 without high school or a job, then my mom dies and I pretty quickly can become homeless.\n\nI genuinely hate the system and didn't want to be born, I am already tired and want to retire but I didn't even work yet.\n\n"

My students were experts in literature, avid home cooks learning recipes from all over the world, and championship esports players. I reached and crushed performance goals. Students who barely knew English wrote excellent essays, and student who previously hated reading now enjoyed it. \n\nWhen I was a teacher, in October and early November, my depression was close to remission. I found happiness in dating a coworker. I listened to Tommee Profit, Fleurie, and Random Chance. \n\nAfter the bus crash, my district non-renewed my contract, leaving me in the dark. The last thing keeping me in this world, was gone.\n\nAs Oklahoma fell into a dark, icy cold, I have started to feel more and more brittle. I forced myself to find new work, even if it led me closer to my suicide. I work until late in the mornings, 9pm-6am. I listen to songs by Badflower and Suffershade and Essenger as I reminisce about those who have replaced and forgotten me,, and take the first careful steps on the ice toward the unspooling day.  \n\nI can't do this anymore. I can't spend time among the living, anymore. \n\nI use to MEAN SOMETHING. I WAS  LIVING PROOF that no matter what you've been through, abuse, violence, homelessness, addiction, food insecurity and binge eating, depression, and no matter how alone you stand, you can achieve your life dream through resilience, grit, and hard work. \n\nNow, I sell what little youth I have left for a pitiful wage, to a corporation that will never know my name, stocking shelves for customers I'll never see. I am a man of the night, evidence of being alive only in the tax books that take half of my back broken money. \n\nNow, exiled from my life's dream, my ears are open but my eyes remain closed and blurry from my Parnate and Nortriptyline. What used to be a life where I neared remission, has become dim and cold . The only picture that looks clear to me is when I pass a mirror, and recognize my face as it emerged from the tray. An unrecognizable man, with lifeless eyes, unkempt curly afro and beard, and bags under my eyes expanding the dark ,soulless look on my face. \n\nAfter fighting the depression and trauma of 13 years, through a babysitter who forced me to play \"the humping game\" to my stepfather who beat me until I cried and screamed and begged, to my mom who laughed at my pain, to the fear and pain homelessness brought, to the adjustments of college, I have nothing left to fight for. I acheived my life's dream, and now, I will never reach it again.\n\nMy mental and physical health are now matching what my emotions always were.\n\nDead."

alot of times and she comes running to me all mad at me and everything and pulls my ear and drags me to the corner for not listening to her and than about 20 minutes later my dad comes out and pulls me away from the corner and he says to me I use to be kind and im not kind anymore and he asks why im acting out and I say to him I dont like her and he asks me why and I say to him I dont know because I was afraid to say it to him im not good at communicating well when it comes to things like this and after I said I dont know my dad slapped me and told me to go sit in the car I was crying the whole time I was talking to him in the corner and he some how didnt get the idea that something must be wrong and the next day my little brother went into the bathroom and came out my Step mom went in and came out asking me and my little brother who forgot to flush the toilet and I was wondering why she would even ask this and flush it herself its no big deal but she makes it seem like one and so I respectively and nicely said I wasnt the one in the bathroom and she told me to go to my room to think about what I did wrong because I was arguing with her when I wasnt I was only answering her simple question and than later she comes into my room and confronts me about what I did wrong I got so mad I yelled at her and told her I was gay and than she says my mom doesnt love me and she does and than she goes on and on about how im gonna get diseases for being gay and about how its unhealthy and she even used the bible as an excuse to her being homophobic and ignores the fact real christians arent supposed to judge and she said being gay is a choice and you dont feel that way and she randomly brought up my aunt on my dads side saying she changed and is now marrying a man and when she didnt win the argument she sent me to live with my mom full time and I was glad about that because I didnt wanna deal with her anymore and my moms a kind and loving person and shes better than my Stepmom in fact shes like one of the kindest people I know I also think my Step mom love bombed my dad into being with her and I think my Step mom manipulated my dad because my parents break up was over all because my mom wouldnt get a job and my dad was struggling with his job a little so he needed more help and my Step mom had a job so I think she took advantage of my dad to leave my mom all because of it and to be with her I also talked to my aunt because my mom messenged her and I found out my Step mom lied about my aunt and shes married to a woman not a man my aunt even said to me the last time she saw my dad was at the wedding my dad also started missing me and talking to me more and he wants me to be nice to my Step mom and he says if It wasnt for her we wouldnt have a roof under our heads and I dont think thats true at all im sure theres someone on my dads side of the family that would love to take us in and I think my dads only saying this because my dad must of called my Step mom out and she pointed it out to make herself seem innocent and just because she does something kind like making sure theres a roof under our heads doesnt mean shes a good person but my dad apparently falls for her manipulative ways easily and im not gonna be respectful to someone like that I also dont sleep much at night and cry most of the night wishing I never said ya to them getting married and I miss when my parents were together "

I\u2019ve been on my own for about 2 years now and have started going to the doctor for the first time in 7 years. I decided to go to a psychiatrist because of some issues I just can\u2019t take anymore. I was diagnosed with OCD which kinda confused me as I don\u2019t know too much about it. I haven\u2019t been able to get more than 3-6 hours of sleep for two years. My brain won\u2019t shut off and I have racing thoughts about things I need to get done that are stressing me out or scenarios that could happen, concerns about my brother and his family, concerns about my future, my dog, past experiences that I read into and wonder what they\u2019re emotions towards me we\u2019re. I am so tired but just can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019ve tried lots of things except prescription meds because I wanted to get the source. It\u2019s takes me about 3 days of no sleep for me to randomly be sitting on the couch or in a chair and I\u2019ll wake up to my Partner saying \"you were asleep like that for 3 hours\". If I clean for long hours, basically exhausting myself, I\u2019m able to lay down and sleep for about 6 hours but I wake up on the hour with my heart beating like I\u2019m anxious. I feel like most the time I have no personality or purpose and nothing brings me joy. Then I randomly get these bursts of energy like I can\u2019t sit still have to clean or run and there a million thoughts going through my head and I feel like I could be some big shot CEO and build a house \ud83d\ude02 something my partner pointing out was that if someone says something or something happens that give some even the slightest negative emotion I just spiral and start thinking about how hopeless I am. I am so mentally exhausted and the only thing that keeps me going is that I have to be here for my partner and my pup dog. I repeat to myself that I just need to bite my tongue and wait this out until I have burst of energy and happiness again. I am also very organized. Not in the head, that\u2019s all over the place \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05 but my room is spotless and precise and I can\u2019t live without my multiple notebooks that I write lists for everything in/journaling. I\u2019ll write a list of things to do when I\u2019m hyper and then feel so overwhelmed and unmotivated after that hyper feeling goes away. I\u2019m only a little bothered with germs, I don\u2019t let my partner kiss the top of my hand, touch my face, or I\u2019ll clean his cup really well so there\u2019s no germs on it. I\u2019m just worried that he might get sick. I definitely get really anxious over talking to people but as soon as I do I become this charismatic person that knows how to ask the right questions and keep the person talking about themselves to make them like me even though I find talking to people kind of unbearable:/ I apologize that this is so long and I appreciate anyone who reads this or even makes it this far.

I\u2019m 23 (M) about to turn 24 next month and for most of my life I\u2019ve been dealing with depression, possibly a personality disorder and I think everyone around me would agree that I\u2019m definitely undiagnosed ADHD or some other type of neurodivergence. I have walked through life feeling like a black sheep for 23 years, I don\u2019t feel as though I fit in with my family, I can\u2019t keep consistent friends and my love life is just as bad. I feel as though there is something fundamentally wrong-with/unlikeable-about me everytime I\u2019m in social situations and I don\u2019t know how to change it.\n\nI\u2019m a very creative person which is unfortunately highly adjacent to mental illness, this has made finding a career and making ends meet very difficult, I just lost my job last month working for a local business that I thought would treat their staff better than a big company *I was so wrong*, finding work has been near impossible since there is a recession in my country and little jobs are going round and even then I\u2019m not hopeful I\u2019ll find a job that\u2019s not some soulless dead-end minimum wage job. My passion is woodworking and making bespoke items which makes me happy but a really hard skill set to apply to today world and industries, I\u2019ve tried to find work in adjacent trades but no employers (country wide) seem to want to take on apprentices or anyone with less than two years experience. I was never very good at school and I\u2019ve never really considered myself to be very intelligent and I\u2019ve never felt very fulfilled in my past retail and hospo jobs which is all I can really get with the experience I have so I don\u2019t know what else I can do.\n\nBack in November before I lost my job I left my partner of 10 months (27F) which unfortunately meant I had to move back in with my parents, while a short relationship I still feel a huge loss, it was a fun and loving relationship for the first 3-5 months but quickly changed and ultimately ended because she was very controlling, hypocritical and an alcoholic (far beyond my own substance habits) who go abusive especially but not exclusively when she was drunk, it took a lot of strength for me to walk away in truth I didn\u2019t think I could survive another relationship breaking down so dramatically but now I am without the security companionship and my friends (who were also hers and remain to be). She still occasionally messages me usually apologising and hoping we can get back together before she soon starts a fight over how everything was my fault, and sadly the truth is I really miss her and still love her in some way but after how she\u2019s treated me I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m even attracted to her anymore and I know it would be the same if we got back together.\n\nFor the short time I have been an adult I have noticed a pattern of spending a couple years trying to get all the pieces of my life in place only for it to all fall apart in under 12 months back to square one\u2026 broke, alone, living with my parents in the town I grew up in with no way out. I don\u2019t really feel like living anymore, I don\u2019t want to and it doesn\u2019t seem worth it, I have a good therapist but it really feels like I\u2019ll never conquer my own internal shit storm. I\u2019m getting a decent amount of money from getting fired unjustly but I think I should leave it to my family who are struggling financially because I think it\u2019s wasted on me "

I got back with my old friends got a regular job and a girlfriend that I wanted to marry. Cut forward a couple of month and she left me after cheating and giving HSV2, all my friends left me behind because \"I wasn't the same\", and I lost my job. Eventually I started working again and found some roommates so I could finally leave that fucking motel. It didn't last for long tho because they kept using my money for drugs (1000 a month btw) until eventually we lost the house. After that I lost by job due to me finally snapping under the pressure from it all. Eventually I got a different job and an apartment but life wasn't done fucking with me. I met this wonderful girl who I shared so many things with and things started moving quickly. For the first time I felt like I wasn't alone and I wasn't numb anymore. Eventually like so many others before she became abusive in a way I had never dealt with before. Every day was a roller coaster that sent me in a constant spiral until my health started getting worse and worse. All I wanted was peace and a chance to breathe but I couldn't. I used to be able to go numb or disassociate but with her it's like that wasn't possible. Eventually she cheated and shit wasn't the same so we broke things off after 6 months. All of that was just the start and theirs so much worse shit that happened afterwards that I'd be hear all night typing this shit out and honestly I don't have the patience to.

As a result of this I threw myself deeply into work and pushed myself to the extreme where i started having debilitating panic attacks and had to stop working. The panic attacks got so bad that i could barely function and couldn't leave my house. This resulted in my just staring at my bedroom walls contempleting every life decision i have ever made whilst questioning my ability to do anything ever again. Convinced myself that i would no longer be able to do anything i enjoyed again, not be able to find work, not be able to socalise and meet new people, not be able to go to the gym and this all led me to the ultimate position of just \"what even is the point\" with everything that I do.\n\nMy anxiety has gotten better and i have been going out more often then before but i just dont see the point anymore. I have been going back to the gym but this is more of an escape as it allows me to forget about what is actually going on in my life but as soon as i leave the gym the realisation of everything just hits so instead of getting that eurphoric feeling, i just feel awful. The same goes for socalising with friends. I find myself just sitting there and observing and being sat in my own little bubble. I find it extremely difficult to stay in conversation with people as i just start completely zoning out and just not listening to anything they are saying no matter how hard i try and remember. This then fuels the thought cycle of not being able to work as how am i supposed to have conversations with people when all i can do is sit there and nod my head.\n\nIm also dealing with some exerstential crisis. My thinking is whats the point of doing anything when we are all going to end up in a wooden box and that just freaks me out. Makes me thing that everthing i say and do has no meaning. As a result, this has complitely crushed any sort of drive, ambition, and purpose that i once had. I have tried setting myself small goals like making sure i keep my room clean, having basic meals, regular excercise etc but i always feed back into this same loop. I used to enjoy waking up in the morning and now i dread going to sleep.\n\nThank you to anyone who reads this and would really appreciate any sort of support. As i was writting this it turned into a bit of a rant to get things off of my chest so i hope it makes sense. :)"

I, like everyone on here, cant live in this state of despair forever. So I thought I'd reach out to my fav sub for advice on a couple things that have put me down quite a bit recently.\n\nIve had tons and tons of extremely intrusive thoughts about not wanting to exist, and being hateful towards myself. It seems like I only lash out on the people who actually care about what im going through. I find distracting myself with a screen, either video games or social media works, but it feels like as soon as the distraction is gone, the thoughts flood back in instantaneously. I have so much anger that stems from these thoughts, i want them to go away so desperately, it angers me they are there in the first place. If i feed into them i end up crying, shaking and convulsing all while i feel like I'm burning up. This is the point where I want to self harm, I've only ever smacked my head into walls, I cant explain it but it feels really good. I need tips on how to deal with these intrusive negative thoughts.\n\nPart 2, ive had a chronic illness since I was 14 (Crohns) and after diagnosis and the hell it felt like i went through, I haven't had many issues at all until this recent monday, i couldnt fucking move the pain was so debilitating. I work 5 days a week in a very blue collar environment. I can't stand the one guy i work with. He makes fun of me for fucking everything, mainly targets my crohns. I had taken 2 days off last week because of my mental health, I had lied to my boss and said it was my crohns but in reality I was just so overwhelmed I really didn't wanna wake up at 6. I obviously heard it from my coworker saying shit like \"you have sand in your vagina again\". Then comes this Monday where I actually have a crohns pain(feels like karma). I leave after being there for a couple hours and go get sorted, I took Tuesday off to do some tests for my doctor. This dick called me just to make fun of me while i was off these past 2 days. now I'm dreading going back to work. I dont want to hear it from this guy i swear I'm gonna punch him and get fired, feels like a 2 birds with one stone solution(hate him and my job) but obviously violence isn't a option.

I have no reason to keep living. Seriously, I think everyone is just lying to each other and saying there's a point to life because they're afraid of death. But why should I be scared? And why am I scared?\nThe \"find your own meaning\" answer really gets to me. There's a question we should be asking ourselves: What is the outcome?\nWhy are we continuing to live in this world? What would finding out our \"destiny\" or making a big contribution to the Earth matter? \n\nStudying science also makes this even more clear to me. From what I can see, there's no point to the universe. There's no end goal to the stars burning in the sky. There's no end goal to species evolving. What's the point? If the entire universe disappeared out of existence and everything was nothing, it's not like anything could happen anymore. If anyone at this very moment just stopped existing, they wouldn't be able to complain because they wouldn't exist. \n\nSo what's the point of existing? What's the point of living? What's the point of being in a situation that we don't have to be in? \n\nEspecially when the situation we find ourselves in is shit. When I and other people with depression find ourselves in a bad situation, we want to kill ourselves. But we should also be pointing out that it's usually because of unique personal problems. Sure, we lose people to suicide every day. This may not be true for all people who have committed suicide, but they usually do it because they're in a bad situation.\n\nWhich is why I'm so confused by all of this. I am not depressed because I have a horrible life, though it's not the best. I'm depressed because I'm so scared of death but so certain of my pointlessness. It's not even that I find myself to be pointless in the grand scheme of things, even though that's true. It's that I find everything to be pointless, even the grand scheme of things. \n\nWell, anyway, I've gotten away from my main point. I don't feel like living just because I don't think anyone should feel like living. If anyone (hopefully) understands my point and has an alternative, please please reply. I'm still scared of death and would love to see if there is a point to life."

Right now I\u2019m 20, taking part-time college classes while I figure out what I want to major in. I don\u2019t know of anything I\u2019m confident I\u2019ll enjoy. \nI have a couple hobbies that bring me some peace and purpose, but it\u2019s not enough. I play in a local metal band & write most of the music. This is where I find the most joy in life, but it\u2019s infamously difficult to make any money off of music so I don\u2019t have any confidence in this as anything more than a passion. Beyond that, most interests I have are for things that are similarly useless for money, like archaeology or Religious Studies. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I could do for a living that would also make me happy.\n\nI had a partner for 5 years, and our relationship was amazing for the most part, but after we came to college together she became poly and cheated on me, leading to our breakup. This was about 5 months ago, and since then I\u2019ve felt so unbelievably lonely. \n\nI remember assuming when I was 8 that I would eventually die by suicide. I\u2019ve never found much joy in being human. It just feels like it\u2019s not for me. The immense amount of effort required to make a successful life for yourself doesn\u2019t feel worth it when every step along that path is crushingly painful and miserable. I don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t kill myself because my mom is dealing with her parents aging and struggling with cancer. If I died, I would absolutely wreck both my parents. But every day feels like torture and I don\u2019t know why and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep going. \n\nI must have done something really truly heinous in a past life, because to exist as I do feels like nothing short of a spiritual punishment. It\u2019s like there\u2019s an alien floating behind my head, invisible, at all times, harvesting my soul for pain and suffering. I don\u2019t know what to do. "

It's like I have multiple personalities in me and they are all attacking me. Telling me that I'm not worth it, that I'm just using space, that I'm a failure.

I have vivid dreams almost every night, sometimes they are confusing me and I don't know when the reality begins and ends.\n\nI can see some things, feel some things that are not for every human eye.

    "content": "Hi everyone,  \n\nI\u2019m a 22-year-old female, not overweight, and I\u2019ve been taking Sertraline since early October. I started at 25 mg and gradually increased to 125 mg (my psychiatrist said I could go up to 150 mg if needed). I\u2019m taking it for depression and skin picking. I take my full Sertraline dose every day at 9 AM.  \n\nOverall, I feel like Sertraline is helping \u2013 it gives me more energy and has slightly improved my mood. However, I\u2019ve been having severe sleep issues since starting the medication, and it\u2019s really wearing me out.  \n\nI wake up multiple times during the night, usually first around 2 AM, then again at 4 AM, 5 AM, 6 AM, and 8 AM. I just want to sleep 8 hours straight, but it feels impossible. Before starting Sertraline, I was able to fall asleep quickly and get around 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Now, even when I do fall asleep, I wake up often, and it can take me anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes (sometimes longer) to get back to sleep. I believe I wake up from REM sleep every time because I can clearly remember my dreams. I also tried using the Sleep Cycle app, and based on my experience with it, I suspect that I\u2019m waking up at the end of each sleep cycle.  \n\nMy psychiatrist previously prescribed Mirtazapine to help with sleep, but I had to stop taking it due to rapid weight gain, which wasn\u2019t good for my mental health \u2013 I gained a lot of weight in just two weeks, and it worsened my depression. I also currently take extended-release melatonin every day at 9 PM, which helps me feel a bit drowsy and stay asleep longer, but I still experience these waking phases throughout the night. I make sure to go to bed by 10 PM at the latest and try to fall asleep shortly after, but despite sticking to this routine, I still struggle with these issues. I feel like the melatonin just masks the issue rather than solving the underlying problem.  \n\nHas anyone experienced similar sleep problems with Sertraline? Do you have any tips for improving sleep? Should I bring this up with my psychiatrist, or maybe consider lowering the dose?  \n\nThanks so much for any advice!  "

    "title": "Lost everything at 33 - struggling to start over and lost the will for anything. ",
    "content": "Hi everyone and thank you for taking the time to read this in advance. I could really use some advice and a helping hand here. I have read various comments on some similar situations and the general advice is that this is a storm and it will pass but it feels really unbearable to me right now with nothing good in sight at all. Am also not that young anymore and I feel I just lost a full decade of hard work. \n\nAs a background I have been a successful trader at an investment bank for the last 10years. I have good degrees from Ivy League universities although I wouldn't consider myself amazingly smart, I am good enough and a hard worker and have done well so far on my own.  I had an amazing salary and decent bonuses but never really saved any money as I enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. Whether this was cars or living a bit beyond my means I always made it work given the decent end of year bonus that always used to put me back on track.  Huge mistake in hindsight. I had an amazing girlfriend and I have a loving dog and life seemed amazing up to this past summer. \n\nSuddenly things turned sour and deteriorated dramatically and very quickly. I suddenly got fired for gross misconduct from my firm on the back of an allegation about a foul comment I made to a female employee at a competing firm. I did make a wrong comment but I got accused for a way worse comment that I did not make. I was naive enough to think that the company would back me and believe me given the circumstances and didn't fight this as much as I could in the disciplinary proceedings. Another huge mistake. Fast forward a few months and after paying lawyers and appealing the decision which I lost, I got terminated and the paycheks stopped right there and there. I suddenly had to move out quickly out of my flat and pack my stuff into storage because I obviously couldn't pay my rent and bills any more. I had to seek emergency funds from my parents who have some money and assets but are not millionaires. On top of that, because of my job specifics and due to the misconduct termination I can't even get employed to competing firms because their HR would drop me. I received multiple calls from other banks to join them (I was decent on my job) but once they all heard the conduct termination admitted to me that they wouldn't actually be able to hire me.\n\nI decided to not rush and  just go back home for a bit and spend time with family, something that I haven't done in years while I relax a bit and think of my options. I had the sense of security mainly due to the fact that I had $500k in vested stock that I could liquiditade this January - so my plan was that I would repay the emergency funds to my parents, go travelling for a bit and then in a couple of months start thinking about which job I want and I can do (bearing in mind the above limitations). Fast forward to this morning, the day I could sell my vested stock and I realise that because I got terminated for cause, the full $500k is gone... it's stilly annoyingly in my name but after reading terms and conditions it's clear that my right to exercise anything on them has been terminated. So that's done... this stock was part of bonus payments of the last years - ie hard work and stress of mine and now it's all gone. I have no savings because i was thinking life as a child and never planned for misfortunes. On top of that my relationship with my girlfriend has deteriorated even before the summer job event because in the past I have hurt her because I cheated and never repaired the trust. I knew this was an issue that needed fixing but never took full initiative to resolve it in the past. I was cocky that I was the \"big dawg\" of the relationship and because we were in love I thought she would eventually overcome this without me doing much. Another mistake. Given am not in the country she is currently as am back with my parents, she now took the chance to take some time apart to try to heal herself. But for me it feels like I lost my job my home my girlfriend, any sense of stability I ever had. My dog is the only thing keeping me sane right now. I have an amazing car that I now also need to give back quickly as I don't want to be paying this high monthly payment. If I had my stocks, that I mistakenly thought I still had I would be in such a better situation.. \n\nTo not make my story longer. I have forever been a cheered up guy with always a smile on me. Since the summer, I feel depressed, nothing gives me joy anymore and if it wasn't for the pain I would incur to my parents and dog I have had moments that I have even thought of suicide. I know it sounds stretched but I really find my mind in dark places, especially when I think of how things have evolved. I feel I didn't deserve this, I was never a bad person to really anyone. I was cocky and loud but i have a good heart and got dropped by everyone in a second. From here I don't know what to do. It's more urgent for me to find a job now but I don't have motivation. I have to start over at 33 and feel like a massive loser when most of my friends are successful and happy. I can't believe I was there only 5 months ago and now have pretty much 0. No love no money no smile. I have increased my alcohol consumption tenfold as this is the only time I don't think of the shitshow I found myself in. I know I am unfair to worst situations out there and I am in advance sorry for this. I don't want to offend anyone I just needed some advice and to really take it off my chest but life to me right now feels unbeareable. Am ashamed I have to ask for more money from my parents and I have very limited flexibility on what to do. I have also done counselling but has not helped me so far. \n"

I'm just so extremely worried that this condition will distance me even further from my family.\n\nRecently for the past 2-3 weeks it's been feeling as if nothing I do matters because it'll all just be a memory someday so what's the point of doing anything at all. I've also started to obsessively question every little thought and action I have, leading to some pretty nasty intrusive/compulsive thoughts including thoughts about hurting others, especially my loved ones who I clearly love and care for very much. I always seem to wake up with a racing heart and a sinking feeling in my stomach and I'm constantly worried that I'm going to go insane over my own thoughts and act out. I'm just so anxious about whether this is going to become a lifelong debilitating thing.\n\nThis entire thing feels very physical as well and is seriously impacting my ability to experience any sort of happiness in life.

    "content": "I (21F), currently live with my parents and brother under the same roof. Parents treat me kind of better than they did when I was a kid, but everytime they show affection now feels fake. Fake to the point it physically hurts me from the pain I feel. I've even cried in secret after my mother tried hugging me(even when I asked her not to multiple times,to no avail and she makes a big deal when I say no).\n\nMy mother has bipolar and when I was a kid, she never took meds. Now,living with a bipolar person who dosen't take their meds is hell. Even though there were two of us(me and my brother), simple mistakes I did triggered her into bipolar episodes. Another trigger was her fighting with my father. All my life, I grew up watching them fighting and then her comparing me with my father, whom she hated the most in the world. \n\nI'll describe an episode for better explanation. It could get triggered by something as simple as me forgetting to fold clothes, and then her going into full silent treatment with me. Ignoring me as if I wasn't present there anymore. Not acknowledging my existence for weeks. Her not replying to anything I said. All while during this time, talking to my brother, serving him food, taking care of him,etc. Imagine a 10-12 year old girl going through this. The catch is, you never knew for what you would be getting this kind of treatment. On one day, forgetting to fold clothes could be completely normal, but on other days, you could get treated like a worthless doormat. You just never knew. \n\nAnd what my father did, was make me apologize to my mother for not being a good kid, when she calmed down. I think this went on until I was 18 or 19. \n\nI grew up feeling unloved and undesirable for most of my life. Unworthy of feeling loved. I worked hard and was a good student till highschool to compensate this and feel some sort of validation from my parents, but what I didn't notice then was my brother wasn't doing any sort of superhuman thing to not recieve the hatred I was receiving. \n\nFast forward some years, I've had extremely kind friends who love me with all their heart. I don't know what I would have been without them. They made me believe I didn't have to do anything to earn love. I could be loved for just who I am. \n\nNow, this fake affection thing from my parents is killing me. My heart breaks living in this house. Flashbacks from my childhood keep coming and simple things trigger me. People showing the same patterns as my parents. Someone raising their voice at me.  Also, I believe I'm sensitive than most people. It breaks my heart to break down at simple things and cry for no reason. \n\nIt's still 1.5 years until I graduate and move out. It feels like a lifetime away. Until then, I don't know how I'll cope up and stay sane. My mother once said she shouldn't have given birth to me. These words come back to me in my darkest hours. Again, I start feeling that I'm undeserving. But I don't want to go yet. I've so many things to do in this world,after I move out from this house. But that feels like an eternity away. And I don't know if I could hold on that long. My mind is a scary place. \n"

I want to die, she wouldn\u2019t let me and called my mom who she just met for Christmas and we\u2019ve been together for nearly three years. Idc if she sees this cause she actually got into the LexusIS Reddit to ask about a car part as my Christmas gift. I never meant to hurt her and it was never physical with them not just because of geography but I don\u2019t like them genuinely. I hid them from her though and i know I need therapy but I do genuinely care about her. Not going into detail but I\u2019ve always help her grow in every way (she moved from west coast to the south with no driver license, little money and having to depend on others,  to stay with and have relationship with dad and go to school but he physically and verbally abused her with everyone else in the house being toxic in some way and I did everything I could to help her and she eventually got her own place.) \n\nI broke down with my mom because we found out years ago essentially on my dad\u2019s death bed that he did the same thing to my mom and I saw how much that hurt her and her questioning everything. So this all made me realize I did something that I never wanted to replicate from my dad."

I dont want to bother my friends because they already have a lot going on.\nrecently i was in some sort of relationship with a 34 year old because he genuinely made me feel wanted and i was lonely. I liked him a whole lot and we had plans to meet up until my friend found out and basically cussed him out of my life. I feel guilty because i am fully aware that he is a pedophile\u2014 and that by talking to him, i was enabling him. I have been in such relationships in the past, all for the same reasons. I feel very ashamed and guilty for enabling these horrid people, and i dont feel like i can tell many people that, because it will prove that im fully aware of my actions and still do them- which i am, but in some sort of way, its just\u2026like an ugly state of mind when i get into these things. I cant explain it.\nI am very very tired. And bordering on suicidal thoughts- mainly because im scared, cause i always am. Im on the average side of looks, and i would say that im a bit above average in smarts. i believe i will go to a decent uni to study architecture even though i am scared of getting sick of it\u2014 it is very versatile and involves a lot of skills, so.

I still dont feel accomplished whatsoever, and its sending me into a spiral again. Im surrounded by smarter people, and it just makes me feel horrible, even though rationally i am aware that my grades and efforts are no laughing stock. \nSorry for the long post, im just ranting. I need to explain because i feel like if i dont i sound worse. But i am tired and i keep doubting myself and ill repeat it again- im so so so very tired. I have so much work and i never enjoy anything anymore, because im constantly pressuring myself to read or do something that will make me smarter- i cant remember the last time i did something because it was silly and fun and not because it would help my college apps or my knowledge or whatever. Theres a pit in me and being busy keeps it away but it also feeds it, and i cant keep it in myself. I feel like im the stupidest person alive. Im constantly ashamed. I feel guilty. \nIf it gives any background- it\u2019s mostly how ive been raised since i was 9. At every mistake ive made my mother would yell that im selfish and egoistic and that im ruining her- i think that plays a part in it. Shes not abusive anymore, she stopped when i hit 10th grade.

    "content": "Hi everyone and thank you for taking the time to read this in advance. I could really use some advice and a helping hand here. I have read various comments on some similar situations and the general advice is that this is a storm and it will pass but it feels really unbearable to me right now with nothing good in sight at all. Am also not that young anymore and I feel I just lost a full decade of hard work. \n\nAs a background I have been a successful trader at an investment bank for the last 10years. I have good degrees from Ivy League universities although I wouldn't consider myself amazingly smart, I am good enough and a hard worker and have done well so far on my own.  I had an amazing salary and decent bonuses but never really saved any money as I enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. Whether this was cars or living a bit beyond my means I always made it work given the decent end of year bonus that always used to put me back on track.  Huge mistake in hindsight. I had an amazing girlfriend and I have a loving dog and life seemed amazing up to this past summer. \n\nSuddenly things turned sour and deteriorated dramatically and very quickly. I suddenly got fired for gross misconduct from my firm on the back of an allegation about a foul comment I made to a female employee at a competing firm. I did make a wrong comment but I got accused for a way worse comment that I did not make. I was naive enough to think that the company would back me and believe me given the circumstances and didn't fight this as much as I could in the disciplinary proceedings. Another huge mistake. Fast forward a few months and after paying lawyers and appealing the decision which I lost, I got terminated and the paycheks stopped right there and there. I suddenly had to move out quickly out of my flat and pack my stuff into storage because I obviously couldn't pay my rent and bills any more. I had to seek emergency funds from my parents who have some money and assets but are not millionaires. On top of that, because of my job specifics and due to the misconduct termination I can't even get employed to competing firms because their HR would drop me. I received multiple calls from other banks to join them (I was decent on my job) but once they all heard the conduct termination admitted to me that they wouldn't actually be able to hire me.\n\nI decided to not rush and  just go back home for a bit and spend time with family, something that I haven't done in years while I relax a bit and think of my options. I had the sense of security mainly due to the fact that I had $500k in vested stock that I could liquiditade this January - so my plan was that I would repay the emergency funds to my parents, go travelling for a bit and then in a couple of months start thinking about which job I want and I can do (bearing in mind the above limitations). Fast forward to this morning, the day I could sell my vested stock and I realise that because I got terminated for cause, the full $500k is gone... it's stilly annoyingly in my name but after reading terms and conditions it's clear that my right to exercise anything on them has been terminated. So that's done... this stock was part of bonus payments of the last years - ie hard work and stress of mine and now it's all gone. I have no savings because i was thinking life as a child and never planned for misfortunes. On top of that my relationship with my girlfriend has deteriorated even before the summer job event because in the past I have hurt her because I cheated and never repaired the trust. I knew this was an issue that needed fixing but never took full initiative to resolve it in the past. I was cocky that I was the \"big dawg\" of the relationship and because we were in love I thought she would eventually overcome this without me doing much. Another mistake. Given am not in the country she is currently as am back with my parents, she now took the chance to take some time apart to try to heal herself. But for me it feels like I lost my job my home my girlfriend, any sense of stability I ever had. My dog is the only thing keeping me sane right now. I have an amazing car that I now also need to give back quickly as I don't want to be paying this high monthly payment. If I had my stocks, that I mistakenly thought I still had I would be in such a better situation.. \n\nTo not make my story longer. I have forever been a cheered up guy with always a smile on me. Since the summer, I feel depressed, nothing gives me joy anymore and if it wasn't for the pain I would incur to my parents and dog I have had moments that I have even thought of suicide. I know it sounds stretched but I really find my mind in dark places, especially when I think of how things have evolved. I feel I didn't deserve this, I was never a bad person to really anyone. I was cocky and loud but i have a good heart and got dropped by everyone in a second. From here I don't know what to do. It's more urgent for me to find a job now but I don't have motivation. I have to start over at 33 and feel like a massive loser when most of my friends are successful and happy. I can't believe I was there only 5 months ago and now have pretty much 0. No love no money no smile. I have increased my alcohol consumption tenfold as this is the only time I don't think of the shitshow I found myself in. I know I am unfair to worst situations out there and I am in advance sorry for this. I don't want to offend anyone I just needed some advice and to really take it off my chest but life to me right now feels unbeareable. Am ashamed I have to ask for more money from my parents and I have very limited flexibility on what to do. I have also done counselling but has not helped me so far. \n\nThank you everyone "

Growing up I was always the \"perfect\" kid, the cousin that everyone gets compared to, the kid that parents never had to worry about, the one that just followed the rules and tried to prove themselves to their parents. Now it's been 3 years that I'm struggling with being in a \"stagnant\" or a \"motionless\" state, I feel chronically tired, I try to be outdoors as much as possible in the hopes of feeling something different but I just don't, I can't get anything done, I don't care abt my studies anymore, I feel like I'm physically and mentally stuck and there's no way out and there's nothing I can do about it, I hate myself and trick myself into thinking that I don't. Everything seems like a chore to me, the basic daily routine things are difficult tasks, taking a shower is hard, making food is hard, studying... don't even get me started on that, everything that I enjoyed before seems to not fill this emptiness that I'm feeling these days, and I can't talk about it because I myself can't explain, and if I do talk people would try and give me clich\u00e9 advice that doesn't really help. I thought maybe if I talk about it it'll help me find a solution but it doesn't make me feel any better, I feel like a part of me is dead but I don't know when or where it died. I don't want to be seen but at the same time I don't want to stay home and be a prey for my thoughts so I go out begging myself to feel something but I just...can't seem to feel anything, then by the end of the week all of the void from those days accumulate and a wave of questioning my whole being overwhelms me and the cycle repeats.\nWhat bothers me the most is that my family is expecting a lot from me and they can't seem to understand that I'm struggling because they care more about social status so they can't grasp the idea of me truly struggling mentally, literally nothing makes me happy anymore and I'm just faking it for the sake of people around me and to \"not kill their mood\" the constant nagging, the yelling, the disappointed looks in their faces say it all and I'm left to deal with their emotions on top of mine, I don't feel okay at all and I have no idea what to do, I'm just living because I'm still alive atp, a wasted potential.\nSorry for being this long and thanks for reading this far.

I remember feeling too big, too ungirly, too idk. Just very uncomfortable, throughout the teenage years. And then I went to Uni and at first it got much worse, especially due to COVID and me being alone a lot. But then I made it back out and honestly felt pretty good about myself.\nHowever, like half a year after this significant improvement. I learned I was not heterosexual and it completely obliterated everything I had worked on. I am guessing that I developed then OCD, but my therapist, whom I saw with that was never fully sure, if she would classify it as this. Nevertheless, it was extremely destabilizing and I experienced crippling rumination, anxiety and depression...fleed into a relationship with a guy to suppress all of it. At first it worked but then as time progressed my mental health got extremely bad and it blew up all in my face. After the breakup I have just never been the same, maybe I wouldn't have been regardless. \nI would still say I struggle from dibilitating anxiety around myself and around other people. I would say I have chronic simmering depressive symptoms, never am really motivated, cannot experience emotions persistently and freely. I still get the rumination/OCD and feel very uncomfortable with being alone for longer periods of time. \nI have to add, in my family there is a long history of mental illnesses. My sister and father have ADHD, which I convinced myself to potentially having, but maybe that is also me avoiding reality.\nI am currently getting tested by a psychiatrist and am considering medication (ADHD or in general)\nI feel like such a failure, I feel like I have lost and destroyed everything in my life and didn't take the right steps earlier. I don't really recognize myself in the mirror anymore or maybe this is who I really am. I really hate that I am always struggling with my mental health. I guess I want to understand this, why I am always feeling so much, maybe there is no answer. \nMore of a vent/rant, but maybe someone has some tips/insights?\nThank you, kind stranger :)"

I\u2019m currently working on a solo game project, so I spend most of my time alone in my room.\n\nI\u2019m also pursuing a master\u2019s degree in computer science, but I haven\u2019t been able to connect with anyone in my class. Our project groups only meet at the university to work, and there\u2019s no interaction beyond that.\n\nI enjoy playing guitar, but I only play alone. I\u2019m too afraid to perform in front of others or join a club or community.\n\nI go to the gym regularly, but again, I do it alone. Day by day, I go through the same routine, but I still can\u2019t make friends there.\n\nI\u2019ve tried talking to people, but many of them have told me that I come across as awkward or strange in the way I behave and speak. I haven\u2019t been able to form any new close friendships.\n\nWhen I go on dates, many girls have told me that I seem overly focused on money or think too much. I remember once saying something like this:\n\n*\"We humans are just animals. If you look at other animals, females choose males based on strength, the ability to provide, or any trait that makes the male stand out and benefit the female\u2014and vice versa. Humans are no different. A man might be rich, a woman might be a great cook, he might be muscular, she might be beautiful, or they might simply understand each other well. There are many people out there who meet these criteria, so no one is truly destined for just one person. We simply choose the best match we can find.\"*\n\nWhy did I say something like that on a date? It made me sound like a weirdo.\n\nI don\u2019t want to keep living like this alone, sitting in my room all day. But I don\u2019t know what to do or where to start. I feel lost.\n\nEdit: I do not ever want to end my life or hurt myself over the time of depression. For years I just felt very stressed, vomited, and couldn't express my thoughts clearly to anyone even to parents or supervisors (teacher). "

I feel a flicker of longing every now and then.. like seeing a couple holding hands, or a movie with love and romance in it, I seldom feel this flicker, but when I do, it\u2019s powerful. I am immediately reminded of course that I have no value, I\u2019m not important or special, I\u2019m just fucked up\u2026\nI am not an ugly person mind you, I have had my fair share of relationships and lovers, I have people asking for my advice, or asking me to sing for them, they flatter me\u2026.but it feels artificial, and flimsy\u2026\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking; \u201cWhat right do you have to complain when you have, at the very least, people who admire you.\u201d \nI can only say, it is a meticulously crafted, and carefully polished mask I wear for everyone.

Perhaps being cheated on, or the deaths of my friends. \nIt could be because I was psychologically tortured by my Step-Grandmother for the first 8 years of my life, and convinced me that my parents hated me and wanted me out of the way, maybe that helped develop this fucked up side of me. I really don\u2019t know.\n\n I can\u2019t point to a single event, perhaps it\u2019s the culmination of all these things\u2026.

As you see, I feel very little if anything anymore. Even if the most beautiful woman on earth came to me, and told me she loves me. \nGave me good reasons why, and what she loves about me. I wouldn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t believe her, because people are inherently liars, and fake. \n\nDon\u2019t trust anyone with your true feelings. Hide them. Women see them as weakness.

I've been on emotional swings for the last one and a half years, and this is probably one of my lowest lows. Before I start I need to get something straight: Never in my life have I received real psychological support, which is probably bad, since my life was spiraling down all this time(who cares anyway, even I don't sometimes), but I think this is an important thing to consider, while reading this.\n\nFirst of all, the injustice in this world is terrifying. Half of the world's wealth is controlled by 1% of the population. Though not majority, immense amount of people lives in poverty, without clean water, food, electricity or even a home. What is more horrifying is that besides this information being common knowledge, no one seems to care about their compatriots or even neighbours. Everyone is busy supporting the corrupted system. Life isn't worth it, because the reward for it does not match all the suffering required to achieve anything. \n\nSecond, Live doesn't have any purpose. All the answers ever given to the most important question in existence are a bunch of philosophical nonsense, that doesn't matter, because this question doesn't really bother that much people. At the end of the day we will all die and all the humanity's achievements will lose all purpose, not that they had any in the first place. Even animals don't have much purpose, but they don't care about it, like we do. Life is just a mistake in the grand scheme of things. Not even a mistake, an accident, because mistakes is what people do. And it is not a happy accident. Life isn't worth it, because it makes no sense and won't ever.\n\nLastly, people are too stupid to make life make sense. We are bound by so much unimportant things, like religion, race, nationality, gender, etc. that we are too blind to understand that our only chance to prosper is unity. People argue everyday about nonsense. They insult eachother, though they are practically all the same. Life isn't worth it, because we can't fill it with purpose.\n\nI don't want to believe all this, but the more time I spend in this world, the more sure of it I become. I, personally, would have ended my life willingly, but the thing is that Life is basically holding me hostage. I, like all of us, was programmed to care about people, who hold benefit to me. And though now benefit is irrelevant, the concept of it is stuck too deep in my mind and I, sadly, can't think of suicide, without thinking about how my relatives or friends would react.\n\n"

    "content": "looking at social media so many young people (early 20s, or even 18/19) are able to move out, buy a car, pay for all expenses (medical, house etc) like it's nothing \n\nI've just had to consider buying a car, because the one I've been driving is old and almost dead. It's a monthly rate and it's not that high...if you don't do anything else. I NEED a car because I live in a sort of secluded place and there's no access to public transport. Most workplaces won't even hire you if you don't have a car, because they know public transport is shit here, and they want \"flexible work hours\" aka if you aren't ready to travel at demand, you're a liability. \n\nSo there's also that. The job market is hell. After getting my degree, I was rejected even by fast food places. I went to so many interviews. I've managed to get hired by a bookstore chain and my pay is not atrocious, but it's a lot of work and I'm basically gripping onto it. They hired me as a part-time and I've had to break my back in order to show I can be hired as a full-time indefinitely. Now I'm full-time, but in a \"trial period\" because initially they had no intention to keep me. Will they? \n\nI'm in a net of small towns, where the jobs are 60% given to relatives. The ones that do hire you, they're infamous for staff recycling. One year and you're out, next one that comes in we can pay a little less than we would you. So job uncertainty, a location that demands you have a car or else you're cut off from everywhere. 4 years of payments. \n\nMy question is, I'm barely standing NOW, that I'm living at my parent's house. How the fuck will I be able to move out? Because according to people online, if you don't move out you're a shame to society or something. But I literally cannot. I would like to. My family is not a happy one and it's detrimental to my mental health. But I literally cannot otherwise. If the job market is shit, the house market is straight up diarrhea. My zone does not want people to live alone. It's only sustainable if you have a partner, and nobody does roommates. Even people who consider roommates shy away from it because \"well I might meet somebody I like since I'm young\" and they go wait for their soulmate. It's ok, but a single person cannot live alone. Even my brother, who worked 12 hours a day for years and had much more money than I do now, only moved out when his girlfriend could because he couldn't live alone. \n\nI barely have a social life now. I have no special expenses in clothes, beauty etc because I don't really bother. I keep myself clean and presentable and that's it. I don't eat out that often. And even like this, I couldn't move out. \n\nSigning a contract for a car that I need feels like signing my death certificate. Because I know it's 4 years of stand-by. It's 4 years of nothing. And I don't know if I can survive them. The dysfunctionality of this household, the inevitable events (my dog dying for instance, or my grandparents) that will send them all spiraling and arguing to violence. I'm depressed, and overmedicated, and I have minor health issues I can't afford to have fixed. \n\nSo how do they do it? How do I do it? When every second spent doing this feels like life wasted? "

I was halfway through college, and we went fully online. For two years, I barely left the house, not even for a walk. Total Isolation became my norm, and I fell into an even deeper rut. By the time I graduated and re-entered the real world, it was like my brain had just stopped working.\n\nNow, I experience these bizarre, brain-dead moments that send me spiraling into a deep depression. For example, last year I stood in front of a push door with my family on the other side, frozen and nearly in tears, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d I could see the door, I understood the concept of \u201cpush,\u201d but my brain just wouldn\u2019t process it. It\u2019s not just doors, these moments pop up randomly, and I feel completely disconnected from myself.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always like this.

I\u2019ve tried therapy, but my therapist hasn\u2019t really done anything to help me. I feel like I\u2019m screaming for help, and no one\u2019s hearing me.\n\nCould depression really cause something like this? Or is it something deeper? I don\u2019t do drugs, I hardly drink alcohol, I recently began exercising and meditating. I don\u2019t even know how to begin fixing it, but I just want to feel like myself again.

I am scared of illness and injury, overly anxious and autistic.\n\nI have got to the point where I am 5uicid4l.\n\nI ran away from wanting anything, because wanting things hurt so much. When you want something; you confront the pain of not having it, or being unable to get it, you feel jealous, bitter and wretched.\n\nThe only thing I desperately want now is a girlfriend. It's ridiculous, and pathetic I know. But I've now been alone for longer than I have ever been in my adult life. I miss so much of what I had with my ex, so many years ago.\n\nI want other things too, I want to be a carpenter, an athlete, a writer, a musician, an artist...\n\nI do have some qualities and positive attributes. I am artistically talented, I am intelligent, I am reasonably good looking and above average height. I also have a good sense of humour.\n\nWhatever happens in the next few months and years will determine if I end my life or not.\n\nI know what I need to do though, I need to exercise, get outside every day, socialise, learn to drive and find work.\n\nI will need to face more fear than I have ever faced in my life, I will need to confront my mentally ill thoughts and break them down, at the same time I will need to work harder than I have ever worked in my life, to strengthen myself physically and mentally."

I don't know why I even try anymore. There's nothing to look forward to. My entire existence has been devoted to aimlessly and pointlessly trying towards nothing drowning in a sea amongst higher beings that look down on me and only come to me when they fall as low, looking for something to lift them up. After I do, I am always thrown to the side. The slow degradation of my former self has just left a shell, painted bright yet all eaten up and rotten inside.

    "content": "I (male in my 20s) was born and raised in San Diego by my mom, a single mother of Korean descent (VERY abnormal for an Asian family). She had me after a hook up with a Chinese man during a tough period in her life when she was battling deep depression. Despite the challenges she faced, we were fortunate\u2014my mom was relatively well-off, so I never felt deprived growing up (at least in a material context). My older sister, who\u2019s eight years older than me, lost her dad to a stroke when she was little. That loss plunged my mom into a dark place, but when I came along, she found the strength to turn her life around. She eventually remarried and had my younger brother, reshaping the dynamics of our family.\n\nI grew up in a Buddhist household. While Buddhism is often portrayed as a tolerant faith, in reality it's not that much less homophobic as Christianity, at least in a Korean context. From a young age, I was a bookish, geeky kid and was always extremely feminine, which made me a target for occasional teasing. Even so, I managed to have a lot of friends and was generally well-liked. But underneath it all, I always felt different, as if I carried a secret I wasn\u2019t ready to share\u2014even with myself.\n\nThat difference started to take shape when I was like 10, in what I now think of as my \u201cgay awakening.\u201d When my older sister left for college, she left behind her collection of CDs, which I listened to obsessively. One album that stood out was No Doubt\u2019s\u00a0*Tragic Kingdom*. I was especially hooked on\u00a0*Just a Girl*, dancing to it every chance I got. One day, mid-dance, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and froze. I, for lack of better words, looked extremely fruity. It nearly gave me a heart attack and shame followed suit. From that moment, I began to see my feelings as something to hide.\n\nBy middle and high school, my inner turmoil grew. I developed my first celebrety crush on Zac Efron after watching\u00a0*High School Musical*\u00a0(talk about cliche, yeesh, he's not even that bad tbh) and even started developing crushes on most of the guys in my classes. At the same time, my mom kept talking about how I\u2019d eventually find a \u201cpretty wife\u201d and settle down. That pressure, combined with my own self-doubt, drove me to bury my feelings. I tried to \u201cfix\u201d myself through various methods like taking up Wing Chun (a Chinese martial art), hoping that it would serve as both a means of connecting with a culture I never knew and as a way of trying to ignite a sort of masculine fire in my soul. Didn't work and spiraled into a depression that lasts to this day that's going on at the same time I'm having an identity crisis over my racial and ethnic background too.\n\nIn college, I went to the other extreme. I became a fuckboy, bouncing from one short relationship to another with any girl who was willing, none lasting more than a few months. Deep down, I knew I wasn\u2019t truly enjoying it (I felt things for a few chicks but like idk). I was a fucking asshole. Looking back, I realize I was desperately trying to convince myself\u2014and everyone else\u2014that I was straight. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u2019t escape the truth.\n\nEventually, I started being open about my sexuality and pretending like I was ok with it on reddit and other online circles (even though I never came out to anyone irl because I have no idea what the fuck to say I am) just to see how it would feel. It felt weird because I'm honestly not ok with it. I wish I was straight. I wish I actually knew what I am. Gay? Bi? Ace? No clue. All I know is I've been playing a role since I was a kid and I'm fucking sick of it.\n\nThe hardest part is that I haven\u2019t come out to my mom yet. I just can\u2019t bring myself to do it. She\u2019s been through so much\u2014losing my sister\u2019s dad, battling depression, and working tirelessly to hold our family together. I feel like I owe her stability, like I can\u2019t add to her burdens. Maybe I see too much of her in myself. She used loveless sex to ignore her problems too (that's how I was born). It makes me wonder if this is some kind of generational trauma, a cycle I\u2019m stuck in.\n\nMost days, I wish I were straight. It would be so much simpler. At least then, I\u2019d have a clear sense of identity instead of this constant uncertainty. I feel weak, ashamed, and terrified of disappointing my mom. It\u2019s like I\u2019m trapped in this endless loop of guilt and confusion, and I don\u2019t know how to break free."

Yes, I got my husband and he's probably the only one I need but I need girl friends. Someone different to talk to. I can't take it any longer. But I also don't want to leave him nor my family with grief. What more can I do? This shit sucks. It's never been this severe. I've dealt with depression but it'll go away in like a week or so. This has been going on for months. Every. Single. Day. "

    "content": "Hello, I am new to this community and wanted to share something to see if anyone has experienced similar feelings. I am currently 21 years old and in college, studying to get into medical school. So far, I\u2019ve struggled to make meaningful connections, and I am constantly anxious about my grades and the upcoming semester. I even experience extreme anxiety during holidays because I know that with each passing day, the next semester is getting closer, and eventually, it arrives.\n\nI also feel that I\u2019ve lost interest in things, including college itself. In the past few semesters, I\u2019ve consistently earned straight A\u2019s, but now it only gives me a brief sense of relief\u2014just enough to think, \"I made it\"\u2014before the worry about the next semester starts again. At the same time, I\u2019ve lost the motivation and meaning behind why I\u2019m doing all of this. Although I\u2019ve never seen a psychologist, I would say that I experience extreme anxiety and possibly depression.\n\nIf I were to trace when these feelings began, I\u2019d say it was about two years ago. Around that time, my grandmother, who raised me, went through a terrible medical condition. While she recovered, she was never the same, and there\u2019s always the lingering fear that it might happen again and take her life. These past two years, I\u2019ve become very anxious about the passage of time, especially during the breaks between semesters. I constantly worry about getting a call while I\u2019m in another city telling me that she has passed away or is in a critical condition. This fear has made me dread the start of new semesters because it means I have to be away from her.\n\nAt the same time, I know I have to keep moving forward in life, which is what I\u2019ve been doing for the past two years. Even though I\u2019m doing well academically, it feels like I\u2019ve lost the motivation and joy that once came with success. I keep working hard to show my family results and to feel like I\u2019m making progress, but it no longer excites me\u2014it\u2019s just something I do.\n\nLastly, I\u2019ve developed a strange recurring fantasy over the past two years. While I know some people who don\u2019t want to wake up again might have similar thoughts, mine feels different. I actually fear death deeply\u2014I think it\u2019s the end, and I want to live as long as possible. Instead, I fantasize about going to sleep and waking up 10 years in the past, a time when life was happier\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar or had this kind of fantasy?"

Even though I managed to keep working and even switch jobs both times, people around me never suspected how much I was struggling. Right now, my life seems stable on the surface: I\u2019m in a good relationship, nice apartment in a posh neighborhood, a nice car, and a small business that is doing reasonably well. But deep inside, I can feel old patterns creeping back, and I\u2019m scared I\u2019m on the verge of another depression.\n\nI grew up in a very poor environment, and no matter how much I accomplish, I still feel like I don\u2019t fully belong in my current world. There are things I can\u2019t talk about with most people around me because they wouldn\u2019t understand my background. That leaves me feeling like I\u2019m just pretending to fit in.\n\nOver the past year, my mom went through two frightening incidents. First, her home was shot at. Then, a month later, she was attacked on a bus while the driver did nothing. I went all out to protect her, writing countless letters and emails to authorities and even getting the mayor involved so that more police would patrol her neighborhood. Thankfully, she is okay now and in the process of being relocated, but I feel completely drained. It\u2019s like all the energy I had went into that crisis, and I\u2019m left feeling empty and unmotivated.\n\nI also feel worthless and alone, even though I know people care about me my brain keeps telling be nobody gives a fick about me, and if I was gone i'd be less of a burden. Some mornings, I wake up and lie in bed for hours, unable to start the day. This is exactly how my previous depressions began, and I want to address it before it spirals. I was seeing a therapist for the past three years(Generalized Anxiety and the previous depressions), but she\u2019s on maternity leave for six months. I\u2019m not against finding another therapist, but it would be expensive and difficult to establish the same level of trust and context all over again.\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar place, where you sense you\u2019re slipping back toward a dark place you\u2019ve been before, how did you stop it from taking over? Were there specific habits, therapies, or mindset changes that helped you stay afloat?\n\nI started praying again, its been years since I prayed,( was recommended by my therapist during our sessions since I know it helps me) \nI am a believer I know it helps me but it is tough, and the guilt of skipping some prayers doesnt help sometimes. (I know some people are not fond of religions, if so please skip this part as I dont want to engage in this specific discussion)\n\n How do you handle feeling like a fraud in a world you don\u2019t feel you belong to, even though you look \u201csuccessful\u201d on the outside?\n\nI would be really grateful for any advice or personal experiences.\n\nTL;DR:\nI have a decent life on paper but I grew up dirt  poor and feel like I don\u2019t belong. My mom recently went through two traumatic incidents, and after helping her, I\u2019m left drained and sensing the onset of another depression.  Any tips on how to stop myself from slipping further would really help."

But with my anxiety through the roof, it\u2019s impossible for me to decide, so I\u2019m here hoping for some feedback from anyone who\u2019s been in a similar situation.\n\nHere\u2019s my background: I\u2019ve been on Paxil 25mg for almost two months. The first two weeks were horrible, but then it got somewhat better. I was still super anxious, though, so my doctor added Wellbutrin 150mg, which I\u2019ve been taking for two weeks now.\n\nSince starting Wellbutrin, I\u2019ve felt horrible again\u2014almost like I did before starting Paxil. My symptoms include:\n\t\u2022\tSevere brain fog (I literally couldn\u2019t focus or process anything)\n\t\u2022\tForgetting everything\n\t\u2022\tComplete indecision (I can\u2019t even decide what to eat, let alone bigger choices)\n\nI told my doctor, and he advised me to stop Wellbutrin. But when I mentioned how Paxil was rough in the beginning and got better with time, I said I wanted to give Wellbutrin more time, especially because I\u2019ve read great things about it.\n\nHe explained that it\u2019s very rare and unusual for an antidepressant to make you feel worse before it makes you feel better. He said Wellbutrin is supposed to complement Paxil, not undo its benefits. Still, I keep reading online (and hearing from my therapist) that it can get worse before it gets better, which makes me hesitant to stop.\n\nMy doctor suggested switching to Zoloft instead, but he\u2019s leaving the decision up to me. I\u2019ve read mixed reviews about Paxil + Wellbutrin and Paxil + Zoloft combos\u2014some people love them, others don\u2019t.\n\nNow I\u2019m completely lost and spiraling with anxiety. I don\u2019t want to make the wrong choice. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Did you stick with Wellbutrin despite feeling bad at first, or did you move on to something else? I\u2019d really appreciate your insights.\n\nThank you so much!"

Like hate against humanity itself. I see a person that does something which, for example, is absolutely cringe, horrendous or whatever and I automatisch hate them with all my heart, wishing they\u2018d just end. Finally disappear. Get rid of their mere existence. There are only few people i still accept or love but most of them i just absolutely hate. Like for example, there\u2019s this one guy in my school. I\u2019m not a bully or something so i won\u2019t bully him but deep down i just absolutely hate that guy. Wishing him the worst. Whatever i can think of. Whatever my imagination may create. And it\u2019s just one example. So it\u2019s like my depression has turned into fucking hate. All of them. Almost all of them i automatically hatte without a real reason. Just because of their mere existence. In my opinion all of us should just fucking die already. Every single one of us. We\u2019re discusting. We\u2019re horrendous. We. Should. All. Die.\nThat\u2019s what came. I was depressed and now here i am. Hating everyone automatically with no reason. Guess that\u2019s what depression caused after all"

They expect you to be able to contribute to society somehow as if you were given a title that gave you your purpose in life when in reality I have no idea what the fuck I'm supposed to do or can do to support the survival of the human race, I mean if the people who wanted me didn't know what I would be doing when I turned 18 how the fuck am I supposed to know what I'm meant to do now? \n\nWhat I hate more is the feeling that maybe I can't contribute to being alive at all. That even though I'm no longer alive just to give two of my elder's purpose, that I have nothing else left to offer anyone or thing.\n\nAnd I don't hate the fact I have to grow up and become independent for the next 80+ years or however long I live or early I die, but it's the fact I have to figure it out. That any of us have to figure it out, and then we have to train to be good, just for some of us to fail over and over again to think that we're worth nothing more than what we were to the two before us... And even some of us aren't good enough to bring joy to the two before us.\n\nWhy is it that despite no one asked to be born and brought into this world, have to decide and figure out what we do with our lives, but that thing can only be something positive for others and if it's not, we're bad people, but if we then said we wanted to die, we're told we can't do that and that we're mentally ill and need mental help.\n\nWhy from the day I was born, could I not just be told what I was going to be doing for the rest of my life and had all the skills and practice ready to go? At least then I'd know I was worth wondering and didn't have to see the same failing result for everything I try no matter what or just know I'd be better off putting a bullet in between my eyebrows and stop wasting the limited resources we have for those that are useful? \n\nIt's so fucking dumb. I hate having to try and make sense of it and wear a smile through it all. Why should I put on a facade to feel happy about the fact I'm worthless to make you happy. Fuck you. Who the fuck are you? I'm not gonna pretend to act like I'm happy when I have no reason to deserve that feeling just to make you feel good. Have you ever felt like you were just a pawn in someone else's happiness until you were no longer needed and now feel as if you have nothing left for society that's worth being alive for? No? Then fuck off then.\n\nSigh... I know my depression is usually just different episodes that do pass overtime. But fuck man. I hate the feeling of being worthless, because I'd rather die than just be worthless to everyone around me. But apparently I'm not allowed to even do that.\n\nI hate failing and not living up to people's expectations so much.

The moment she asked me if I ever thought about killing myself was the moment something in me just snapped. I had never cried in front of these people before but I just couldn't contain myself. it felt good for the days after that night, that some people showed that someone cared, however now it all seems stupid.\n\nI felt down last week and actually tried to get help. the psychologists I tried to see had a waiting time of almost 3 months, the fact that people have to wait 3 months to get help if they need it would make me depressed if I wasn't already. But I decided to confess to one of those friends who sat with me a year ago at that party, only this time it just felt like it wasnt \"new\" or \"sensational\" to them anymore.

    "content": "TDLR: Therapist considered me suicidal, I almost got admitted to inpatient which made me feel way worse than I did in the first place, now I don\u2019t want to search for a new therapist.\n\nLast weekend, I had my initial appointment with a new therapist online. To preface, I have not ever considered myself suicidal nor a threat to myself even though I have had thoughts. When the new therapist was going through the \u201cscoreboard\u201d for suicidal thoughts, she concluded that I am a moderate risk. She said she wouldn\u2019t be comfortable seeing me again and told me to go to a mental health center immediately after the call. I listened to her and went. At the center, there was another sit down chat where they did the screening with the same result. They recommended inpatient, but told me that it was my choice. I did not want to miss work and I truly just don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve helped. I agreed to do outpatient.\n\nThey called the next day to detail the options of outpatient, which were either five days per week during my work hours\u201420 hours per week\u2014or three days a week in which I\u2019d have to leave work an hour early\u20149 hours per week. I decided not to do either. I love my job and I do not want to ruin the only consistent thing I have in my life. I truly don\u2019t feel like I need hours of therapy every week, I just want a single appointment. That whole day made me feel like my world was crashing down. The stress I felt and the tears I shed were so overwhelming. Since I\u2019ve had time to think about it, I truly think it made me catastrophize my life and I\u2019m feeling so much more comfortable since I\u2019ve had time to settle back into everyday life.\n\nNow, I just feel discouraged even looking for a new therapist because I don\u2019t want to be rejected again. It just feels like such an oxymoron to refuse help because a person needs too much help. I do understand why, but it doesn\u2019t make it less frustrating. I had already called a few therapists in town before I scheduled with the person online and nobody had availability. Making phone calls and appointments in general is stressful for me and I push them off as long as possible.\n\nI\u2019m also hurt that my mom hasn\u2019t checked up on me after I told her about it, especially since she\u2019s had her fair share of mental health issues so she understands what I\u2019m going through. Actually, nobody really has except for my roommate. I just feel very isolated, and I don\u2019t know what next steps to take."

It\u2019s easy to understand sadness or happiness or anger and pleasure. But right now I feel almost void of all of these emotions.\n\nAt times I do want to kill myself, but I don\u2019t see it as an actual desire or something I actually would try to do. It\u2019s more of a coping mechanism for stress. But what I feel right now is almost unbearable. It feels like I can\u2019t focus, can\u2019t think, and can\u2019t reason. It\u2019s like trying to make sense of something that doesn\u2019t exist. \n\nI wake up every day and feel a sort of numbness. I\u2019m not really interested in doing anything so I find  something that can give me short term pleasure and do it.  But nothing feels like anything. It all feels empty and void. It feels like I\u2019m chasing feeling but nothing comes. It\u2019s why I\u2019m so obsessed with reading stories full of some kind of emotion. \n\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m an existence that can\u2019t be defined. If someone were to ask me who I was or what I am and desire. Besides saying human flesh and consciousness I can\u2019t think of anything else. It feels like I\u2019ve become disconnected from my emotions and feelings and ideas. \n\nIt\u2019s similar with love as well, while I could describe it for days on end. It feels like I can\u2019t actually feel it. I\u2019ve never fell in love, and while I see my parents as people close to me, I don\u2019t feel any sense of empathy or love  towards them. It\u2019s more just I\u2019m obligated to stay connected with them as they birthed me into existence and were with me while I grew up. \n\nThis feeling is absolutely horrifying and feels wrong. It makes me feel like a husk or a shell of a being. Like I\u2019m missing something that should make me normal. I wonder what it would be like to fall in love, I wonder what true happiness or Sadness feels like. All I feel now are maybe short bursts of pleasure and frustration directed at myself and the world. \n\nIf anyone can give a decent explanation of what I\u2019m feeling with its corresponding term I\u2019d be thankful beyond belief. But in all honesty, maybe it\u2019s stupid of me to try to define and explain something that by its very nature doesn\u2019t exist. "

If anyone has any advice, I will be very grateful.\n\nWhen I was very young, I was very good at school and I was always among the top students (I wasn't the top student, but my dream was to be so) until I was in the sixth grade. I finally achieved something I had been dreaming of and I came first at school. After that, I kept coming first at school, but on the other hand, there was no interest or reward from my mother, I was doing everything to get her to love me and accept me and it was as if I was literally doing nothing. Just because I had OCD and couldn't get myself off the books, I kept coming first at school, without any motivation or incentive. My mother never cared about anything I did, and she never really talked to me or had a deep conversation or advised me about anything. She always ignored me and literally distanced herself from me, to the point that when she would distance herself from me, I would ask her, \"Mom...do I smell bad?\"  She used to say, \"No, I just don't like anyone to come near me.\" I would always call her and she wouldn't answer if she was in the kitchen or watching TV, although she would answer any of my other siblings normally, to the point that we would have a lot of fights because of her not answering me. I would run to my grandmother and complain to her, but nothing would change in the end. Now that I've grown up a bit, I'm 17 years old. I no longer like my mom or hate her. I discovered the \"Mommy's Issues\" thing and found that everything applies to me. I've never been attracted to girls my age. I always imagine an older woman hugging me or even putting me to sleep in bed, and this issue is causing me to hate myself because sometimes it arouses me and makes me even more upset with myself. I no longer think about sexual thoughts, nor do I have anything to do with girls at all. All my thoughts are about hugs and having a maternal figure in my life to whom I can return and cry when life becomes too much for me. If anyone has the same issue, please share so i feel less lonely. Note that I\u2019ve literally never talked to a girl, and that might be because of my mommy issues. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll manage to get into a relationship with a girl until I marry her, and that makes me feel like I\u2019ll live and die alone."

Growing up I\u2019ve always thought I wouldn\u2019t be mad if I wouldn\u2019t wake up the next day to now wanting to take my own life even at times thinking of ways to do it. \n\nSorry for the long rant but I guess I just wanted some advice on ways to better myself and take care of my mental health. I go to the gym, read among other things. \n\nThank you guys anything is appreciated "

    "title": "How can I be happy?",
    "content": "I (19M) have had depression (clinically) for about 2 years now, there was a point around June to July of last year where I was genuinely happy with myself, but now, I'm just always sad, and I can't seem to figure out why. \n\nAm I relying too much on others? I'm actively trying to vent less, I know venting is healthy, but I feel it just perpetuates my overall sadness, I was **MUCH** happier when I didn't vent or talk about my problems at all.\n\nDo I set too high of expectations? I'm a very loyal person, to a fault I'd say, so when someone wrongs me in any way, I just wanna drop them on the spot, because I try my absolute and very best to never wrong or hurt others in any way, because, I know full well what it's like to be hurt and betrayed by those you love.\n\nIs it my family? I live in a very abusive environment, abusive in all but physical and sexual. I have two older siblings (32F and 38M), my dad treats my brother far better than me, even though my brother has done and said bad things to my father. My dad name calls me, calls me lazy, bum, and all sorts of colorful language I won't get into here since I don't particularly like to use any sort of vulgarity.\n\nIs it because I'm socially isolated? My mother has prevented me on many occasions from socializing with friends at Church (I am a practicing Catholic). She has no ill intentions whatsoever, but she's very anxious about something bad happening. As such, I really don't have many friends in real life. I also live in a very depressed area, the average age of my county is **65**, and most of the surrounding counties aren't much better.\n\nWhat should I do? Where do I even go from here? I've had online friends offer me to live with them (I've met them, very nice people, and there's been circumstances where their trust has been tested and they've proven themselves, so I'm not walking into darkness here). I genuinely am considering it heavily.\n\nI don't want to be depressed and anxious anymore, I want to escape this, but I need to know how to do this. Please, if you can offer any advice or support, I'd much appreciate it. "

For the past few months I've felt my mental health deminish but I don't know if it's really depression and if I should seek help and I need some advice. \n\n  \nAt first it was just a lack of motivation to do small things, then low motivation to do anything, then low energy, then lots of \"depressive moods\". Some days I don't have the energy and motivation to get out of bed and call in sick. I've started thinking about my own death a lot and feeling uncertain about my future, though I am NOT suicidal. I've also gotten strong urges to cut myself. \n\n  \nI am still functioning and not a threat to myself, but I feel like this isn't getting healthy. Any advice? Thanks"

That's the kind of  role model that I had in my childhood. I always hated the way that he behaved, I thought that he will be better of dead. \nRecently I started to notice that I'm unconsciously repeating his behaviour, I feel pretty bad about my work, I haven't been able to find a good place to work, and when I did, I messed everything up due to my own emotions and lack of confidence. I had to leave college, because my mother couldn't pay anymore for it, and I'm kinda of searching for a meaning now \nIdk where my words are going, I'm just feeling like a mess, always pissed off and repeating my father's behaviour \n\nBe happy and take care of yourself, people "

    "content": "I want to preface this by saying I don\u2019t even know if I do or don\u2019t have depression, I can take this post down if need be. I don\u2019t know what the hell is wrong with me, but there definitely is, seeing as I can\u2019t change for the better at all even though I want to. I don\u2019t know how to explain what I feel, self hate, complete emptiness at times, hopelessness all the time. Melancholy, extreme irritability, pushing others away by making them hate me so life is easier with less to worry about. Though I can still be happy (although that\u2019s rare) and laugh when I see or hear something funny so idk.\n\nI turn 20 this year which makes me feel horrible. I just want to be a kid again after wasting my childhood. I want to just ball up under my sheets and blankets and never leave my room. I\u2019ve wasted the last 4 fucking years doing absolutely nothing to progress as a person. I\u2019ve wanted to get my shit together so I can focus on college, but I haven\u2019t seen a doctor, a therapist, or even just talked to my parents. I\u2019ve just been going to work, going home, eating, sleeping, etc. since I know I\u2019ll just fuck everything up like at college and not do anything while I\u2019m there like last year. I still don\u2019t have my drivers license.\n\nI literally never thought I would make it this far in life, and I don\u2019t care to make it any further either. I just want to be normal, but god forbid I do anything healthy like working out more than once a month. How am I supposed to change/get better if I don\u2019t try? It\u2019s like my brain wants to stay this way because it\u2019s more \u201ccomfortable\u201d and I hate it so much. I\u2019m so tired of all this bs, why does it have to happen to me? I\u2019m as average as they come, so why?"

    "content": "Hi! I am a 19f college student in sophomore year and I feel like I am starting to feel depressed. I know depression is a serious disease and it would be inappropriate to just walk in and say that I am starting to feel it but idk what l'm even trying to do with this post, ig it's some cry for help...\nI have been feeling so hopeless and desperate lately. I don't know what tf I want to do with my life, there is nothing that ! ambition for my future. I don't have any dreams. I just live from day to day goals.\nAlso, the only person that I have genuinely fell in love with does not even exist anymore :/ and will never know that I existed.\nI am bad at what I do. I am failing at everything. Everyone around me just got their shit together except for me it seems...\nReally! I am the only one repeating courses. I have made no friends in college. Just acquaintances that I have lost contact with. I don't have any way to meet people with my same interests. I just feel so lost and hopeless for what is to come. I cry everyday and feel so hopeless. It's driving me mad, idk what to do anymore. It takes a heck ton of effort to do the things I have to do. I have no energy. Things that used to make me happy are not doing anything to me anymore.! would love it if I could get in contact with someone who feels the same way and connect and help each other or if there's anyone who has gone through this to give me any insights. Idk what I am trying to do with this post and feel so out of my comfort zone, but I guess this is just some cry for help."

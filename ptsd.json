    "content": "I'm confused about these two terms and looking for insight from others in how these are experienced.I guess it's also because cPTSD is not formally recognised that the confusion is there.\n\nI've heard some people compare it as single event vs repeated events. But then I've also read that childhood trauma increases the chance of getting PTSD later in life.\n\n* So is it really ever single event?\n* Or is it just cPTSD lays dormant to be triggered later in life for some people?\n\nI've read that cPTSD has additional symptoms like relationship problems and problems regulating mood.\n\n* But then doesn't PTSD cause these things anyway? Relationships can become strained with PTSD and moods are affected with triggers, right?\n* Also I read posts of people with cPTSD who are married or in long term relationship, holding down jobs and seem functional (pls don't take this as not believing the cPTSD diagnosis, I get that a short post doesn't tell the whole story, but it's confusing me about the definitions). Is it just differing levels of functioning for both PTSD and cPTSD?\n\nAgain, I really hope this doesn't come out as invalidating, minimising or insensitive. I'm just trying to understand."

I was raped when I was 5-7, I was sexully assaulted when I was 14-15, and sexually assaulted last year.\n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to do the deed on new years. It was perfectly fine and went as I'd always imagined or wanted it to. 2 days later, I realized I didn't want him to touch me or be near me, same with other people. I felt repulsed any time anybody touched me. Once I had realized these emotions, I had a huge mental breakdown that went on for almost 2 hours, I was crying hysterically and having hallucinations. About a week later I was okay again.. and now I'm back to not wanting to be touched.. and honestly it flip flops. I don't know what these feelings are but they won't go away. I love my boyfriend more than anything, he is so perfect. But my mind has been telling me I dislike him in some way when I know it's not true, and i think it may be some intrusive thoughts because of what happened in the past.

    "content": "It\u2019s always been tough with my family. My mother had a traumatic upbringing\u2014she was unwanted as a firstborn female child and suffered violent consequences from her parents. She has severe PTSD and depression, and when I was little, she completely crashed. She hasn\u2019t worked or pursued any education since. She spent many months in a psychiatric ward and has been on medication for decades now. \n\nMy father stuck around, but he had to work long hours to pay for everything, so he wasn\u2019t really present either. My mother has a Stockholm syndrome-like relationship with her own mother, who\u2019s now in her late 80s and still drags her down with constant comments about her weight and appearance. Despite this, my mother never set boundaries with her. Instead, she constantly recites her mother\u2019s toxic comments and gossips about her behind her back.\n\nThis behavior extends to everyone\u2014my brother, me, even random people. She\u2019s immature, entitled, and spends her days flipping through gossip magazines, watching TV, or meeting up with toxic \u201cfriends\u201d who come and go because she can\u2019t maintain real relationships.\n\nI moved far away from her as soon as I could, but because of the housing crisis, I ended up moving back closer. Now I see her every couple of weeks, and it\u2019s exhausting. I\u2019ve worked hard to build a successful career and am constantly trying to improve myself, but she only sees me as a housewife. Both my partner and I work full-time, yet she\u2019ll make comments like, \u201cI\u2019m sure you still need to cook for your husband today.\u201d It\u2019s infuriating.\n\nI\u2019ve been interviewing for new positions lately, and I keep hearing her toxic, minimizing voice in my head, doubting my achievements and making me feel small. I can\u2019t stand it anymore. My dad is a good man, but he\u2019s never stood up to her or her toxic family, which leaves me feeling so unsupported.\n\nWhat really drives it home is when I see \u201cnormal\u201d families. For example, there\u2019s a lovely woman who used to be my kindergarten teacher. When we run into each other, she\u2019ll ask thoughtful questions about my work and seem genuinely interested. My mother, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t even understand what I do. She only asks about chores or household tasks, and it\u2019s like she reduces my entire life to being a housewife\u2014something she\u2019s always done.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve worked so hard to overcome my toxic childhood, where I was stuck with her while my father was absent working long hours. She never believed in me and constantly told me I wasn\u2019t smart enough. Now, even when I\u2019ve achieved so much, I feel like her voice is still in my head.\n\nI need to get that voice out of my life. I can\u2019t keep living like this, constantly feeling like I\u2019m not enough, especially when I see glimpses of how normal, supportive families interact.\n\nWhat can I do? How can I stop letting her toxic influence control my thoughts and self-worth?"

And I wish I died back then because my life is so much worse now. More trauma. My life is just trauma after trauma really. I\u2019ve been abused in a special needs school. Had to save my friend who tried to kill herself infront of me. Another friend overdosed on coke infront of me and had a seizure not on purpose he overdid it and I didn\u2019t do drugs back so I didn\u2019t know what to do I called an amulance and my friend hated me for snitching because I could\u2019ve gotten him in trouble. I was self harming to cope with this at 11 but worse after all of this extra trauma. I got diagnosed with PTSD at 14. Around this time instead of self harm I started drinking and vaping and doing drugs so I didn\u2019t have to deal with the constant memories of what happened and stuff. \n\nNow I\u2019m such a loser. I have unrelated health issues so had to stop going to college (UK). I spend most of my days in bed wanting to kill myself. Today I went and got edibles and got am bottle of vodka too from the shops. I have a fake ID but by now cause um a regular he doesn\u2019t even check. The highlight of my day was the shopkeeper flirting with me saying I\u2019m hot even though really I\u2019m not and giving me a discount on the vodka. Which is just sad really I mean why is that my highlight? Honestly it\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s happened to me in months probably. Everyone hates me.\n\nMy flashbacks get worse at night. It\u2019s currently 1 in the morning and my flashbacks have been bad. I drank half of the bottle even though I was trying to stick to a quater and I don\u2019t even think I\u2019m that drunk. I\u2019ve also don\u2019t two edibles and have been vaping as well just to extra be able to forget but no.\n\nUsually I\u2019d be too out of it to care but every once in a while like today I feel worse and just want to die even more.\n\nWhat has my life even come too? \n\nEverything was great until I was 8(when the trauma started) I genuinely think if I never had the traumas I would be so successful. I was smart and kind and funny and easygoing. And I had a lot of potential. Now I\u2019m dumb and depressed and not easy to have a conversation with and just genuinely the worst person to ever live I do so much awful and dumb shit.\n\nI just want it to all be over. No one cares about me. I just want someone to love me unconditionally. I have no friends and I\u2019m going to be homeless when I\u2019m 18 because my family hate me and so can\u2019t get a paid job. \n\nI just want someone to actually listen to me and care about me.

But things still did. Although it was consensual when the encounters were happening, after we parted ways months later I had realized it was all tricks. They were calling me baby and claim themselves \u201cbf\u201d and me \u201ctheir woman\u201d balabala cuz I thought them I\u2019d want a serious relationship. But at the end they still said \u201cyou had wrong impression and expectation\u201d.  Afterwards I was basically \u201cbegging\u201d to see him cuz I didn\u2019t want it to turn into a casual thing(although it still did), it lasted 1.5 months and finally he said those things and we cut off completely. \n\nI was so desperate cuz I never had any relationships or sex before that and I thought I was unworthy of it. So when someone finally offered me some \u201cattention\u201d I started to hold onto it hard. I later heard from someone else that he was even calling \u201cclinging\u201d when I just wanted my first sexual encounter to work out instead of only being a one night stand.\n\nDuring those sexual encounters he was always very selfish, didn\u2019t care if I have pleasure and would do some bdsm-act on me too. \n\nNow I find myself trying hard to \u201cwin\u201d this encounter and understand and conceptualize what happened.

I thought about therapy but with constantly changing jobs I find it hard to stick to therapy when every company offered different coverage and plans. \n\nThey were not the only one whom I had unpleasant sexual encounters with but they were the one triggered me the most. Whenever I go to the town they were at, see someone who physically resembled them, see someone worked at same company, certain words, certain emojis, etc I\u2019d often find myself getting drawn back to the dark moments.

As a child I assimilated sex with something bad, hurtful and something that can kill. \nI just want to hear your opinion about this, because I will not be getting a girlfriend anyway (I got extremely low self esteem, nearly nonexistent self esteem, that\u2019s another whole topic), so I am not scared of losing a sex life. \nThank you.

Fear and anxiety are through the roof, and it hasn't gotten better in months.\n\nJust, talk to me? I find it pretty pointless to talk here, when everything ends up in either ghosting, or unwanted advice. But just in case someone actually feels like shit like me and wants mutual support? I have to try even if everything feels pointless.\n\nI'm more used to younger people, probably because I'm so not far in life and I went back to college recently. Maybe it has to do with how trauma makes me feel stalled in my early to mid 20s. At least that's still adult age, right? .... trying to laugh about it but it's not funny.\n\nI have a lot of relationship trauma, but I won't discuss it publicly. I wish for once I met someone who values agreements instead of rigid boundaries, being scared of hurt, being defensive, and lacking trust. They always end up screwing me over.\n\nMy ex was my everything, and she betrayed me. One of many almost successful attempts at permanently breaking isolation. It feels so heavy and painful to always be back to square one. I have no personality disorders, autism, or anything particular except having been a victim of gaslighting and abuse. I can socialize decently and I would much prefer video calls, or voice calls. I mean, in person is my ideal, but given how this is the internet, im fine with long distance options that feel warmer than text.\n\nI hate the internet and the messed up gender dynamics because I often feel more comfortable opening up to women and that might be related to how going back to studies in a field that is almost only females has shaped my mind for the last 3 years. Also my ex was my only friend at that point in time, and I had no energy left to look for friends.\n\nI hate that saying this online there is this automatic assumption of some creepy gross behavior that I'd rather not discuss here. No, I'm a real human being, damnit. I'll stop before I trigger myself, tbh. Being unjustly framed as some bad person when I did nothing wrong is one of my worst triggers."

He abandoned both mentioned girls and I actually don\u2019t remember anything of his time with us other than being left in the older girls sick in a den we made after eating too much chocolate cake, her dad had taken her to his bed and left me sleeping in it. It\u2019s the only thing I remember. \n\nI would later go on to try stuff with my half sister at age 9 or 10 for a few months, started st was ealing from school bags and kissing girls behind whiteboards on breaktimes. Started smoking weed at 12 and have never stopped. \n\nI\u2019ve always always had emotional regularity issues I assumed was teen hormones but I\u2019m 26 now and I still have panic attacks, I still sing one minute and my world ends the next, I can turn off my emotions when someone does me wrong and all I think is that I\u2019m hated and fuc them, then it\u2019s days of guilt and clinginess and thinking I\u2019ve ruined everything. \n\nInternally I think I\u2019ve accepted I may display BPD symptoms but the only \u201ctrauma\u201d in my life has been infidelity. \n\nIs there a chance something happened to me? Does it sound like something did? How did the older girl know how to practice kissing? Why do I not remember a man I lived with for 3 years but things before him?

I hate hate hate myself for it after too, ironically. And it\u2019s only shops, not personal, not to justify though) \n\nEither I had a bang on the head, I was traumatised between 2 and 6 and have suppressed it or I\u2019m an inherently shitty person. I couldn\u2019t never prove or even tell you I remember someone SA\u2019ing me (in childhood) but it may justify my crazy emotions. \n\nDoes it sound possible or am I being totally unfair, I don\u2019t want to accuse anyone or ruin a man\u2019s life if I ever spoke about the questions I have. is this something you\u2019d bring to a therapist yourself? \n\n\nSorry it\u2019s long, tia x"

I just remember seeing the car and saying fuck. The next thing I know I'm waking up in the hospital with my hands tied to the bed and a breathing tube post surgery. I spent almost a month in the icu. All my injuries are on the left side of my body. I broke ribs 2 through 10, had 3 surgeries. One was life saving on a ruptured bladder. The other were both thumbs broke and needed pins and screws. And my clavicle broke and needed pinned.  I have my sternum broken and 2 vertabree t1 and t2 are broken, I had a collapsed lung, also  had a bad concussion and a massive hemotoma on my thigh the size of a football. \n\nI recently got a therapist because I haven't been able to cope mentally. I'm honestly still not there.  On the way to physical therapy the other day a bike pulled up next to us and I froze. I was the passenger thank goodness. Didn't even realize I froze. Then all of the sudden tears. The waterworks just started. Uncontrollably. All I could think about was him dying. Or my friends getting hit and dying. \n\nI wake up in the night with terrors. I am remembering more of the accident my brain blocked out. My friend was with me and confirms what I remember now is valid. She and a stranger kept holding my head telling me \"don't move and it's OK buddy you'll be ok\"\n\nI'm not educated in any of this but I was surprised that an accident could cause ptsd. I thought it was only things like war vets could get.  Please forgive my ignorance. I genuinely just didn't know. \n\nMy therapist wants to get me a new kind of therapy called EMDR therapy.  I really hope I can shake these feelings. I used to love riding. It was almost my entire personality. I've been down in the past and was able to heal and get back on a bike. Riding genuinely made me happy. It saved me from my darkest spot in life. I don't have really any other hobbies. I'm afraid I'll never get over this fear and worried I will never ride again.

Please note that patient lives in the Phillippines where plenty of above mentioned pschychiartrists, pain Management, and other therapies are not available unlike in United States or UK.\n\n The patients concerned about his recent behavior change over the past 2 months. He has been taking 50mg of zoloft for one year, then was recently brought up to 100mg.ocer Christmas, when he has almost Zero Social interaction with his closest friends. He went away and didnt take the zoloft. In addition he has been pro actively been on top of taking his supplements, and vitamin D.  In addition to stem cell therapy, he was also given testorone replacement therapy which he has not taken due to his wifes addiction to her cellphone, and promises she will do it but despite constant naghing of the patient she continues to forget or not communicate. He has not had had a testorone shot in 3 months. \n\nThe patient has become increasingly withdrawn and neglects his children, has completely withdrawn from his wife. They are non-speaking terms but only Co-exist for their two children. The eldest is 14 and youngest is 8. The patient concerned that the mother without notice moved to another room and both children no longer sleep as they did from the time they were born until last month.\n\nThe patient was pined to a gap and a Train smashed him in 2008 and his entire pelvis, bladder, bladder neck were destroyed. To be presice he was brought to hospital in Paris suffering from Pelvic, acetabular fractures, lost his prostate, suffers from incontinence, and erectile dysfunction. \n\nSince the accident, he has become more and more emotionally withdrawn (probably more over the past), isolated and suffers from tremor nerve pains, had an 18 hour surgery where he coded for 5 minutes from a dbt. He was in ICU for two weeks, and has had close to 7-8 months of being in bed from Orthopedic Surgeon instructions. In addition for 8 months and maybe a year from normal funcfioning this traumatic event  caused him treamandous stress being  unable to care for himself.  Ihas become a full blown addict. Physical examination shows titanium rods in lumbar of spine, left and right hip and Internal fixatures for them. Scars in his left and right legs and back. \n\nI am concerned my main concern that I am spiraling. Even though l live in Philippines I am willing to put the time to get the help I sincerely desperately need. I have contacted Standford and UCSF hospitals but I am open to suggestions for assistance in private practice.\n\nI am forever grateful for this opportunity that I can share and find support I need.\n\nFrom bottom of my heart thank you\u2764\ufe0f"

Also, i used to go to haunted corn mazes with guys chasing you with chain saws and 0 lights and was never scared as a 13 yr old so idk what the fuck happened this year for those 2 things to happen?? But yeah\u2026 and now I went from gifted to having to go on academic probation (still recovering from that \ud83d\ude2d) and also having random panic attacks and hard time making friends and presenting and all this horrible social anxiety and its insane bc i was never like this as a kid.

Here, we applied TMR in PTSD patients to strengthen therapeutic memories during sleep after one treatment session with eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).\n\nEffects of TMR on sleep were assessed through high-density polysomnography. Effects on treatment outcome were assessed through subjective, autonomic, and fMRI responses to script-driven imagery (SDI) of the targeted traumatic memory and overall PTSD symptom level. Compared to sham stimulation, TMR led to stimulus-locked increases in SO and spindle dynamics, which correlated positively with PTSD symptom reduction in the TMR group. Given the role of SOs and spindles in memory consolidation, these findings suggest that TMR may have strengthened the consolidation of the EMDR-treatment memory. Clinically, TMR vs. sham stimulation resulted in a larger reduction of avoidance level during SDI. TMR did not disturb sleep or trigger nightmares. Together, these data provide first proof of principle that TMR may be a safe and viable future treatment augmentation strategy for PTSD."

Lately, we\u2019ve been fighting daily\u2014or every other day for a year\u2014about him not showing up for me emotionally in the ways I\u2019ve clearly asked for. I\u2019m not asking for grand gestures, but for small things, like showing interest in me or wanting to date me again.\n\nThe lack of emotional connection feels deeply triggering, as I grew up with a narcissistic parent, and this dynamic has started to mirror that. It\u2019s sending me into a headspace where I feel like I\u2019m losing my grip\u2014struggling to sleep, feeling more paranoid, and fearing a return to the psychosis I experienced years ago when emotional abuse was at its peak- i\u2019m not saying that my partner is emotionally abusing me. It\u2019s just triggering the same feelings I had when I was. I\u2019ve taken every approach with my partner and I\u2019m at a point where I just don\u2019t feel like he even likes me as a person. He claims to like me and says that he loves me, but he talks more than he does.\n\nI\u2019m currently in therapy, medicated, and working with my doctor to adjust my medication as needed. I\u2019ve decided to stop begging for my partner to show up for me\u2014I\u2019ve even tried making a list of small, inexpensive date ideas to make it easier for him to engage. Nothing has changed, so I\u2019ve shifted to gray-rocking while I figure out my next steps.\n\nThis whole situation has left me crying every day, feeling emotionally raw, and honestly, just\u2026 exhausted. I have a degenerative physical disability, no family, and no friends to lean on, so I\u2019m doing my best to hold everything together. My ACE score is a 7/10, which I think can let you know my experiences without having to talk about them.\n\nIf anyone has advice on how to cope with situations like this\u2014how to hold onto your dreams, your sense of self, and your mental health when everything feels overwhelming\u2014I would really appreciate it.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this.\n"

I know how to drive fucking well no matter what cause I work in healthcare, I drove in a freaking ice storm to work when I used to work in the ICU. Now imma drive like a grandma when I drive again \n\nMaybe having ptsd already makes me prone to feel this way more? I also have borderline and that doesn\u2019t help. \n\nI\u2019m in therapy and doing all the things and have really made a lot of progress but this shit was scary like wtf. Thank goodness I had therapy last night. \nAnyone relate even from a different circumstance? \nOr idk maybe just something comforting for me? \nHow do you get through things like this?\nI don\u2019t know what I need.

When I was a kid I was not only sexually assaulted by my dad but also physically by him and my sister.  Once when he was sexually assaulting me I slapped him and he hung me. I could not feel the floor beneath my feet. My sister was also abused and she told. I kept quiet and even though I am over 60 I still can\u2019t tell anyone. Both parents are passed, and I have little contact with her. \n\nFor decades I thought I had escaped although I lived with depression and anxiety and anorexia. \n\nThen bc I had an affair (please don\u2019t judge me harshly) my ex (married 25 years) became angry and as he was never able to express himself he began each morning for several months stepping on my forehead while I was sleeping. I plain disassociated as it was on the heals of another trauma and I couldn\u2019t handle the truth of it. When I woke I would say (just gonna say here that I was smoking pot like a fiend trying to get through the other trauma) what is happening and he said he was tying his shoe. Yes, this is crazy I know. Fast forward a few years, and I asked him to confirm and he confirmed and after our divorce said he was sorry and didn\u2019t know what came over him. He\u2019d never been physically just emotionally abusive before this. \n\nToday I often feel overwhelmed with this and often rethink it many many times a day. \n\nBy the way, I am no longer getting stoned, and feel I was to not address this very difficult past and present. I\u2019ve seen therapists but have a very difficult time expressing and explaining myself.\n\nCan y\u2019all say words of encouragement please. As I have 2 children who are grown I am not going to take my life, but feel like he took away my ability to laugh and live a normal life.

    "content": "Hey, so I already made a post about this a bit earlier - how I realised one of my main traumas may be being stuck in a car with my dad and mom, him driving recklessly and telling us he will kill us and I felt like I couldn't breathe or even blink or show emotion or nothing, because I was worried that if he catches a glimpse of me, he will get upset even more and we will die. I remember the feeling of how I just wanted to be invisible....\n\nMany times I would tell people that my parents didn't really allow any emotions of mine and people think it is the classical \"SHUSH DON'T CRY\" in the shopping mall. But I guess it is a bit different than when you really fear for your life.\n\nI am going through an emotional period now and I realised I did breathe in a very shallow manner. Factually - I have always had the feeling like I don't want to breathe a lot or when I woke up, my limbs were just incredibly heavy and I felt like I could not move. I wanted to, but everything took so much effort. It was like I was trying to push through liquid sand.\n\nANYWAY back to now - I did notice the shallow breath and so I told myself I will try breathing deeper. I did. And the emotions came. And I knew it would happen, but I wondered why. Because so many times just taking a big breath feels SCARY. Then I tried to sway from side to side a bit. Again - fear, discomfort, and a huge wave of emotions. Just tears. And I guess I just realised it is because my body is afraid of moving because it signals \"YOU WILL DIE\". And this is.... Quite nice. To show up for myself and show myself it is in fact safe to move and nothing will harm me. It is uncomfortable and I almost feel nauseous.  \nAnd again yes, it is something I knew my entire life that may be because I am afraid. But now knowing the CLEAR example of a moment when I felt that way.... It helps.....\n\nThe thing is - do you think this is enough? Can I do this on my own to heal? Or do you think I should find a trauma therapist? I was in therapy and they did not grant me the trauma treatment because they said I have no trauma as I do not have ONE nightmare or a flashback. And I don't have money to just go to a private one, but maybe I can just talk to my GP.... I don't know."

    "content": "I never had depression, panic attacks, or sleep problems, but that all changed in December when I started taking high doses of methylated B12. I would also like to add that I do not work. I am at home with my family.\n\nAfter two weeks of taking the vitamin (December 13), I had severe panic attacks at night, psychosis, derealization, I had the worst thoughts, I had no idea what was happening to me. I didn't sleep the whole night. At that time I didn't know it was from vitamin B12.\n\nIn the following days I felt better (I wasn't taking the vitamin at that time), until I took large doses of B12 again on December 17. The same thing happened again as on December 13.\n\nThe next few days were a real nightmare. I cried all the time, I couldn't do anything. I sat on the bed all day and didn't move. I had the worst thoughts, terrible depression and anxiety. Each minute felt like an hour. I felt that my life was over. I had a strong pressure in my head. I had panic attacks even before getting in the car. I was terrified of literally everything (darkness, tight spaces, loneliness, etc.)\n\nI didn't know what was happening to me or what I could do to feel better. I found out that high doses of B12 can cause methylation issues and that niacin/niacinamide can help. I started taking them and felt marginally better.\n\nThen I reduced my niacin dose and started feeling worse again. I feel a huge trauma inside me. Every time I feel a little better, I think it's going to get worse again.\n\nI don't even know how to describe the condition I'm in, but I'll try:\n\n* First, my brain has completely shut down. I have absolutely no thoughts. And when I do, they are highly negative.\n* My perception of time has changed. Time moves very, very slowly. Every day seems excruciatingly long.\n* Depression. Everything makes me extremely sad. Wherever I look, I feel deep despair. I can't watch TV, read books, talk to someone or anything, because I constantly feel such negative feelings that I want to explode (it's slightly better after I cry). I feel numb, dead inside.\n* I can't sleep (I fall asleep at 4am and for just 2-3 hours and it's been like that for a MONTH).\n* Horrible anxiety and occasional panic attacks (+ adrenaline rushes)\n* Complete anhedonia (I have no feelings and I haven't felt any positive feelings for a month), lack of interest in anything.\n* Depersonalization (everything seems artificial, I feel like I'm alone and somehow I see the world around me differently).\n* Very little desire to eat (or no appetite).\n* Dizziness, nausea, headaches, vision problems etc.\n* It's hard for me to do anything (cook, clean, etc.) because it constantly reminds me how terrible I feel.\n* I don't really feel exhausted. I feel overstimulated. I'm not sleepy.\n\nI don't know where to seek help anymore. I went to a psychiatrist and he said it was depression and anxiety, although I didn't even have time to tell him half of what I've written here.\n\nI definitely feel terribly traumatized after all of this. I keep saying that I need to forget everything that happened and that it will help me feel better.\n\nI'm afraid of many things now. I'm especially afraid of situations that made me feel worse. I had a few of those in the car. I felt absolute terror, an indescribable depression. It was as if all the negativity in the world had thrown itself at me. Every second I thought about jumping out of the car and ending it all. That traumatized me the most and that's what I'm most afraid of. I would do anything and give anything to forget about it completly.\n\nI just feel like my whole life has been destroyed, I feel like a zombie. I can't do much. I feel crazy. Unable to function normally. I live in my head all the time and I feel a huge fear that it will all come back again.\n\nI don't know if it's PTSD or something else, that's why I'm asking for advice.

I don't see any way this can get better and I don't see a way I can ever make new friends or meet a man and want the goals I want in my life to be fulfilled. I go back and forth every day with trying to kill myself . I have already had one unsccusssful attempt. I really want to know if it will get better because I honestly don't think that it will ever. I don't see a way out of this. I also don't see a way of making this better. I know everything below is my fault and I fucked up my life and now I can't live with myself. Please read the below story for context. I am mentally suffering and I am really afraid.\n\nI got engaged on my 29th bday (31F currently) to a man (now 32M) in 2022. I was so happy because I truly loved my partner. Rewind the times a bit - when I had first met him all was beautiful, his family loved me , his friends adored me. They were happy to see their family / friend with someone like me. Like every whirlwind romance, I had gone through some phases with him. I had gotten pregnant (and ultimately decided was not ready to be a mother) . When I brought up the pregnancy, I figured he loves me so much he will support me. To which he did support my decision but the first thing he brought up after me telling him I was pregnant was his ex girlfriend and her child which left me feeling extremely hurt , as really what does that have to do with you or myself? I got over it. I won't forget how we went away a week after and I was advised not to have sex. He told me I was exaggerating and against doctors orders I obliged to my partner.\n\nUnfortunately I wound up pregnant again, not from that incident and I was not ready to be a mom. I did what I had to do - again not that there wasn't support but it just felt like I had to get over it quickly. And that's very hard for someone who is going through those things. Fast forward few months after that, his sisters (who are around my age , one is the same age as me) would always get together and go out and do brunch with my partners brothers gf who was much younger than me but often felt she was the voice of reason.\n\nUnderstandably so my partner saw they were going out and stated why don't you invite her (meaning me), they huddled and contemplated and stated they didn't want a fourth person to join. I was also not offended by this as his sisters are heavy drinkers and I am not , also I don't want to be anyone's babysitter when they can't control themselves. Weeks go by, it is now August and it is the fathers birthday. I along with the others were invited for a bday dinner. I thought the night was going well until the sister who was my age showed up and the brother and his gf and they flat out ignored me the whole night. Anytime I tried to engage in conversation I was just shut down or ignored. This left me feeling completely horrible as I put my head down because it was evident by everyone at the table they were doing it on purpose.\n\nAfter that night I was completely ignored by two of his theee siblings - to this day I will never know why. I told my ex it's not right - that I can't do a relationship like this. He did stick up for me but it only got worse. We got engaged , his siblings did not show up or congratulate me on my engagement, leaving me to feel very horrible about what I could have possibly done when I was very friendly with them, bought food over anytime I came to visit , would try to befriend them or send memes or texts or try and plan things.\n\nI should preface this post by saying I am a calm person, passive, quiet. Him and his family are loud and obnoxious. After we got engaged my fianc\u00e9 told me they all hate me because they thought I was a gold digger. I had never in my life asked for my ex to pay a single thing of mine, I never asked him for money, I never even brought up money. I have a career in health, I went to college. Eventually when things got nasty between my ex and I he would remind me that his sister who is merely a receptionist was more successful than me. Which is not true btw lol.\n\nEventually things got worse. I went through his phone and found him talking terribly about me to a friend who actively cheats on his wife - talking about how he wants to \"bang\" this girl but doesn't want to get caught (we were engagd and went through so much) his friend encouraged. Him to cheat and said as long as I don't find out who cares. I found other messages, stating from his friends when are you gonna dump her already - you can do better - turning fights that he started on me - things about wedding planning he would say the opposite. We bought a house together.\n\nAt the same time of the closing my mom was going to treat me and pay for a small bridal shower- what girl doesn't want to feel like a queen? He told me if I did that he'd dump me and that I needed to only focus on the house. Eventually after the house I wanted to get a part time job as he always worked and rarely spent time with me. He told me I will make him look broke and forced me to quit my part time job. I wanted to purchase my own car - he told me nope forget that idea. I had to one day corner his sister after MONTHS of verbal abuse - there was an incident in the summer where she called me a moocher and told me I suck and he should leave me - eventually I confronted her, while I was dealing with my last relative being alive from cancer . She told me it's not you it's my brother , bullshit.\n\nI couldn't keep up with the family's itinerary as it was all about them and never about my life or the things I wanted to do with my fiancee. I couldn't even visit my mom at some point. He eventually forced me to almost take my life because of mental distress . There is so much more to this story, I am furthest from perfect but I tried. Does this sound normal to you?\n\nI should also mention while we were engaged he wanted to continuously hang out with his exes family although I stated it made me uncomfortable. She was also always I. The picture. His friends would often bring her up and I could never chime in on the convo bc it was awkward for me.\n\nFurthermore I want to mention the first time I ever met his best friend he asked me what kind of house I lived in and what kind of car I drove. Do you think he must've painted me in a bad light for all of this to happen? I'm so lost, ashamed, embarrassed. 32 and I feel like what is my life anymore. Sometimes I want to just give up. I hate myself.i Want to also add in - I did try and talk to the father and let him know how I felt when the sister was being awful to me. His words were , well what did you do to her?\n\nHis aunt also told me that she (his sibling) never wanted me around because she didn\u2019t want to babysit me. His grandma , who has 8 granddaughters always told me oh hunny you need to let the man lead the way and you just follow\u2026. Lady it\u2019s 2025.\n\nNeedless to say now I am going to be 32, I am broke, no direction in life and literally nothing to show for my life besides my career. I just want to get my feet back on the ground - but I literally don't know how. This whole situation has consumed my mental health so badly. Please no judgement , apologies for the long post.\n\nI don't want to join an app. It is overwhelming enough to sit with these problems. I am still unraveling from all that has happened. I don't know what to do anymore"

It's from grades 7th till 12th which I consider far worse, because the bullies got specific and definitely knew better. I will mention that my parents were pretty cool, so fortunately no abuse at home bar some cases where the \"disciplining\" went a bit far.\n\nI can't stress enough how pissed off I have been getting about this, and always have. Even though after school when I met new people they seemed to like me far more, een though college was pretty smooth and I made great friends, I still get so damn angry. Like, I would suddenly remember being kneed in the back for a \"laugh\", or held down, or put in a chokehold, or just being laughed at. The nicknames didn't stop, I was short and not very strong and it was like a damn crime. People like saying how \"height isn't everything\" and yet I still get teased, and when you have been trated near subhumanly for being short, it doesn't really count as fun.\n\nWhat's more is since being young I can remember that I developed serious fantasies of being hurt and then lashing out. When i was in 2nd grade, the fantasies were pretty much buried alive and turning into a dinosaur or  being so hurt that they would perform surgery on me and I'd turn into the terminator. As I have grown up, the fantasies have become far more serious. Only recently I have figured out why this happens, but stopping is really difficult.\n\nAny nightmares I have are always about school. I can have a nightmare about being eaten alive and not bat an eye, but being back in those damned hallways makes my skin crawl.\n\nI had hoped that the good experiences would eventually surpass the bad and I'd be okay, but it's only now that my parents' \"Get over it, forgive and forget\" advice sounds so hollow. How the fuck do I forget?? Feeling that powerless. . . The \"fight back\" thing didn't work because unlike movies the bullies wre indeed fiercer and stronger, they saw me fighting back as an insult and hit harder. I couldn't leave them alone, and eventually you get tired of the same thing over and over. You get tired of being told that you are overreacting. . . \n\nAnd what's worse is I still don't know if it is valid or not. The fantasizing especially makes it difficult, because I think \"am I just forcing myself to be sad?\" because I genuinely can't remember a lot of the grades. What if things weren't that bad and I'm concentrating the bad into it being years of shit? \n\nSo many of the experiences people have in high school I didn't have. When I graduated and everyone was taking picture with big friend groups and making memories I was alone. I only made actual friends after school, in college, and even then now that I have graduated, everyone is on their own path. While my friends have their own childhood friends, I have none. And now because I am an adult, I can't \"hold onto a grudge\", even though a lot of times I find myself wanting to bash their heads in. But that wouldn't happen. Back then I couldn't fight back because I was weak, now I can't because it's not \"mature\". Even when I was a kid, i could get hit, but the moment I did something \"naughty\", I'm far worse than the actual fucking bullies.\n\nWHat stings the most is, they don't care. I doubt they even remember. I have spent hours finding and stalking some of their socials, to see what they're up to. Honestly, it soldified that they have moved on. They have their own lives, while I have to deal with the shit that isn't my fault. Even \"live a good life\" sounds hollow sometimes. . . Good in respect to what? The bullshit is still there! Add to that the severe low self esteem, and you have a wonderful package. It's not exactly easy to just have self worth after being treated like you are deserving of every bad thing that happened. . . self worth is NOT infinite!\n\nTL;DR - Childhood bulying sucks and I fucking hate every single one of them."

But recovery is so damn exhausting, you probably know what i am talking about. its a hell of a rollercoaster ride and i just ask myself if i\u00b4ll ever be able to live normally again. i dont see the light of the tunnel yet, or is there even a light, idk.\n\ni know, i am still in recovery and its probably normal but i feel so lost after this medical shitshow that happended to me. i dont know who i am, i dont know where to go in life. i was a young, innocent girl full of dreams, that are now all replaced by fear and doubt. i don\u00b4t know this person i once was anymore. literally, all the \u201cbig goals\u201d i had for the near future are now out of reach. in the past i had energy and i believed in me, nothing seamed impossible. now i am happy if i make it trough the day successfully and if i can cope with daily life.\n\ni also feel so out of touch with my peers. barely anybody my age has or had similar issues like me. i only wish i had \u201cnormal\u201d problems that people experience in their early twenties. i also feel that i scare anyone my age if i share what happened to me and why i basically diappeared for almost a year. i simply cannot continue my life where i once left. i feel so alone and out of place. i have a lovibg and very supportive family that i am very grateful for and that helped me in those troublesome time, but yeah other than that i feel isolated and lonely.\n\nim soon finished with my education, which i dont see myself working in anymore. so far i got students support which soon ends, so i also have to find a job soon. i also have to move out from my dorm soon. So a lot of change is about to happen, since i rather crave stability atm but it is what it is. well, some day this thought of getting a cute and cheap little place for myself, and some part time job, would give me some motivation and energy to get my life back on track. on other days its seems to be completely pointless and surreal. well lets see.\n\ni know, it\u00b4ll have to give myself more time to heal and i\u00b4m still in the middle of recovery, but yeah, sometimes its just hard. i know it could be much worse and other people have it much worse, but yeah. like i said i dont know why i share this, maybe someone can resonate or tell me that there is some light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nthanks for reading, much love and hugs for my fellow fighters,\nxoxoxo\n<333\n"

It's like I can feel myself operating on a level I only knew before everything bad happened. I can laugh at things with joy not hate, I can take what someone tells me at face value without automatically doubting or disbelieving it, I can feel what I imagine it is like to be \"normal.\"  And during those times, I feel a mix of bliss and terror, because it's so enjoyable & nostalgic & beautiful, but I know it'll end and I wish to gawd that I could just be like that all the time but I can't and getting a taste of what I'm missing out on terrifies me. It's like being half unburdened. It trips me out because I know when I'm sober, I'll be back to my normal; Generally distrustful, checked-out, depressed, lost, disturbed, afraid, heartbroken.

It's scares me. I scare myself.  So yeah maybe I shouldn't be using marijuana, but I always think I'll enjoy the escape..... And I worry that if I didn't do the occasional edible, I'd just continue being blind to it all......... \n\nI guess I wanna know: Are these ideas even real, valid, accurate?  These revelations about how truly fucked in the head I am? These fleeting moments of being almost unaffected by my past? The feeling of objectively studying my psychology and seeing the truth about life & people,  supposedly unobscured by my biases caused by my ptsd?

Divorce isn't simple or easy. I realized I was slipping away, moving beyond passively self-destructive into active. I found a psychiatrist after so many turned me down as too complex. Btw, my diagnoses are: MDD, AD, and PTSD from childhood. Throw in that I was diagnosed with ADD in 1975, it gets hard to find people.\n\nI found a clinic that's walking distance from my place and lo, and behold, after one session the doctor said she felt Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation offered the best path forward. Please know that it's a commitment. I went 36 straight work days from late November to early January. They say that consistency is critical in ensuring a good outcome, and I know the alternative was not good.\n\nIt has done a truly amazing job lifting my emotional floor from deep sobbing several times a day to now, where I'm realizing the toughest work might be moving forward without tears or the level of self-loathing I've spent a lifetime perfecting. \n\nI'm not cured by any means, but now that my floor has been lifted so much, I feel like my job is to learn how to be happy instead of avoiding pain and the mountain of emotions behind the pain. I also know that none of these therapies are consistent in application.\n\nFor me, TMS has been life-saving. Do I still have the thoughts? Yeah, but now that my emotional well has been filled in a bit more, I can find time to actually use the tools instead of using them and hoping today is a good day.\n\nThere are a lot of therapies.

It\u2019s just one man\u2019s journey, what\u2019s worked, what hasn\u2019t and what I\u2019ve learnt along the way. Most of this literally happens in my head. I really wish someone (a therapist, a psychiatrist, a psychotherapist, anyone) that my brain on PTSD would be unreliable.\n\nSo spoiler alert \ud83d\udea8 in my experience all of the dating difficulties I face as someone living with PTSD stem from shame, wanting acceptance, fear of rejection, impaired thinking, seeking external \u2018love\u2019 in place of self love and a complete inability to sit with my feelings. Funnily enough the feelings most difficult to sit usually follow positive experiences.\n\nA bit about me for context, I am in my early 40s, male and l spent most of my adult life in one relationship although remained childless. I have been out of that relationship for almost 2 years now (it was the PTSD symptoms that ended up putting a lot of pressure on the relationship). I haven\u2019t worked since the events that caused my PTSD but have been financially stable through insurance related to how the PTSD occurred, this is also how I have accessed treatment.\n\nI was in a major city for the first period of dating and have spent the past 4 months dating regionally. I have done almost all my dating exclusively via dating apps (tindr, bumble, hinge).\n\nFor added context, the events that caused my PTSD occurred 6 years ago, I was diagnosed a year later but by that time I was heavily drug addicted and spent about 4 years in addiction so I couldn\u2019t really get my symptoms treated until I was clean and sober. It\u2019s been almost 2 years that I have had my PTSD symptoms treated. There might be some overlap with the comorbidity of PTSD and addiction and definitely feels like a lot of baggage to bring to a relationship.\n\nTreatments I have had include 3 three week inpatient stays at my countries leading trauma based psychiatric hospital, group therapy, weekly therapy (recently moved to fortnightly) and monthly psychiatrist (recently moved quarterly). Medication that I\u2019m currently on is Mirtazapine (helps me sleep and is meant to be anti anxiety/depression) and clonadine (is a blood pressure medication but can be used for PTSD and has really helped in reducing my physical reaction and the intensity of flashbacks). I was on another medication called Prazosin which literally stopped nightmares. I only have nightmares now when I\u2019m triggered or stressed. \n\nAdditionally I have ADHD and I use stimulant medication as prescribed.\n\nFor the past 2 years I have done a daily mindfulness program. This includes reading affirmations, praying, writing a gratitude list and meditation. Every evening I journal about my day and my feelings.\n\nI thought I was ready to get back out there way before I was. At 6 months clean and sober, 7 months out of a relationship and 4 years of PTSD I got on tindr. At this point I wasn\u2019t comfortable discussing my diagnosis so from the drop there was no chance of me forming any sort of authentic connection. I got a decent amount of matches and was able to organize a handful of hookups. Regardless of how well (or badly) the hookups went they wreaked havoc on my mental health. \n\nLooking back at now it\u2019s clear I was seeking was some sort of validation. This was probably my lowest point emotionally since becoming clean and sober. Although most of the women were cool and some of the experiences felt very validating in the moment it wasn\u2019t the connection I actually yearned for. My PTSD symptoms got to an all time high around here, my nightmares got worse, flashbacks and anxiety were relentless and I became almost obsessed with getting more matches. Around this time my ex was hitting me up for hookups but even with a women I was very familiar with they were ultimately very detrimental to my mental health.\n\nThe validation I sought from the hookups was related to some internalized  insecurity in my masculinity. It was related to my inability to accept that I had PTSD and why I turned to drugs and alcohol. I couldn\u2019t accept that I had been a victim as  my life experiences/influences had taught me that victims were women or men who couldn\u2019t perform masculinity. Not being a victim had become part of my persona as a child as a way to deal with the neglect, abuse and abandonment I experienced from all my care givers. This translated into having terrible boundaries and taking in way to much as an adult, getting all my self esteem from status, achievements and eventually put me in the position to experience the events that left me with PTSD.\n\nI am really grateful that I had regular therapy at this point as well as mates I trusted. With support I was able to realize I needed to work on myself because no woman from tindr would be able to fix me. I also read a couple of books by Bell Hooks which helped me understand some of the shame I was feeling.\n\nAround 6 months after my initial foray into tindr I was getting ready for my 3rd inpatient stay at a psychiatric hospital which coincidentally coincided with my only experiences with (nearly) dating women I knew from real life. \n\nA woman I knew from recovery started calling me and wanted to meet up for coffee. We had a couple of chats over the phone but I didn\u2019t make myself available to meet up with her and eventually ghosted her. At the time I just couldn\u2019t think of a more constructive way to manage it. I do regret ghosting her as it was just a shitty way to manage it. I did run into her a few months later and apologized and told her my anxiety was just out of control which was essentially true. Looking back now tho, we had nothing in common and the only reason I even contemplated meeting with her was because I found her attractive and she seemed to like me. Again, it was validation seeking.\n\nOn either side of my psychiatric hospital stay I met women through mutual friends. Both showed interest and made the first step in contacting me and asking me on a date. I didn\u2019t take either of them up on it and eventually ghosted. \n\nThere was a lot of fear, avoidance and lack of self love involved in this. Both of these women knew my story in terms of PTSD and addiction so I was able to convince myself they must be a bit emotionally unstable to want to date me. When the part of me that craves connection, acceptance and intimacy would push me to get back to them I would catastrophize with imagined scenarios about a disastrous relationship that ultimately destroys all my friendships. Seriously, this is where my PTSD mind took me when all that had happened was a nice woman asked me if I would like to go to an art gallery with her and another if I would like to meet for coffee. I have regret about being too afraid to go on these dates and I genuinely did want to at the time but my anxiety and impaired thinking just wouldn\u2019t allow it. I wish I had understood how low stakes first dates are (intellectually I did but PTSD).\n\nThe reality is that the later 2 never dates was it only ever came up once with my friends. My mate asked me if the woman who asked me for coffee had rang me. I replied no (she texted) and we never spoke about her again and our friendship carried on. With hindsight being what it is I can see I was driven by avoidance, fear, unworthiness and being a bit disconnected from reality in general. \n\nFor the next few months I was on and off bumble. I would create an account (sometimes paid) and would spend hours crafting the perfect profile to attract the type of women I\u2019m interested in which would be validated by the metric of likes, matches and messages received. I would then be overwhelmed with the imagined pressure to respond, maybe message with a couple of women then delete my profile only to run the same loop again in a few weeks. \n\nI only had 2 dates throughout this period and both were pretty disastrous. My loneliness and desperation for acceptance made everything seem incredibly high stakes. I was also incredibly insecure about how I had spent the past 5 years of my life and trying to show up and be authentic and genuine was impossible. Pre PTSD my career had been central to my identity and I carried a lot of shame about addiction and having PTSD.\n\nI spent the next couple of months off the apps as I was planning on leaving the city I was in and I was doing a lot of intensive therapy. I focused on friendships and getting out of my comfort zone in safe and playful ways.\n\nWhen I relocated 4 months ago I got on bumble straight away. There has been a pattern of when my life circumstances are uncertain and/or I\u2019m dealing with triggering legal proceedings and/or dealing with adversarial insurance companies I hit the dating apps the hardest. This definitely hasn\u2019t been healthy and is more evidence of my complete inability to sit with my feelings. \n\nIn the past 4 months I have had a total of 9 dates with 6 women the first 7 happening in late October and early November. In this period I have learnt the most about myself, modern dating, how my PTSD affects me and some much needed boundaries. \n\nI was pretty pessimistic about my chances of getting matches with my preferences after moving to the country but was pleasantly surprised.\n\nI had 4 first dates in quick succession. What I learnt was that was I cannot book multiple dates in the same week. If I have a bad first date on a Thursday afternoon and have another booked for Saturday morning, I\u2019m gonna bring that same bad date energy to Saturday morning. I also felt somewhat disingenuous having multiple dates booked with different women. I realize it\u2019s a reality of modern dating but for me to manage my PTSD symptoms I can only date one person at a time even if I\u2019m talking to more on the apps.\n\nThe first woman I went on multiple dates with was really lovely. When I gave her a hug at the end of our first date I experienced butterflies in my stomach that I hadn\u2019t experienced since the late 90s lol. It was unexpected, nice and hasn\u2019t happened since.\n\nI still wasn\u2019t comfortable to share about my PTSD diagnosis or my addiction history. I framed my PTSD symptoms as burn out from my career and said I didn\u2019t drink because it made my anxiety worse. It turns out when I\u2019m being inauthentic it makes my anxiety worse.\n\nWith hindsight I would have canceled our 2nd date as I was completely triggered for it. That day I had received a summery of facts from my barrister and seeing the incidents that caused my PTSD in dot points felt incredibly reductive. I actually talked about it on my date and described some of the events which was so much more triggering for me. In my experience trying to avoid the whole story just makes what I share worse and more triggered. The woman I was dating was a real trooper tho, she worked as a medical specialist and I feel like she used her professional skills to save the date.\n\nThe 3rd date we played board and card games at her house. I genuinely believe she was screening me to make sure it was anxiety that had me acting weird and not an intellectual disability. At this point I really wanted to be upfront about my history but was in avoidance mode. She initiated intimacy which I initially went with but then freaked out, apologized and left.\n\nI can\u2019t say for sure what was going through my head in the moment. I had a realization on the way home that I want real intimacy where I feel known and I was the one withholding it. In effect my shame had me abandoning myself when all I wanted was acceptance but I wasn\u2019t allowing my authentic self to be seen.\n\nI drafted a couple of texts explaining that it didn\u2019t feel right as I had withheld information etc but never sent. A couple of days later she sent me a message wishing me the best but she wasn\u2019t feeling the spark. I felt sad but also incredibly relieved. I was shocked with how relieved I was. \n\nThe following days I deleted my bumble account and ruminated on how amazing she was. Maybe she was the most amazing woman I would ever meet etc. I did some embarrassing stalkerish shit I would have never expected from me. I googled her, found her work and community organizations she was on the board of. One of the organizations was in a walking route I did with my dog\u2026 I genuinely was already walking that way and continued to but I would day dream about running into her and explaining everything etc. \n\nI still feel embarrassed thinking about those dates and how I obsessed in days following. I am grateful for the experience as there were some really nice moments and I learnt I need to be authentic and vulnerable for a chance at the intimacy I want.\n\nI had a psychiatrist appointment in December and he told me he wanted me to go on one date a month. I honestly can\u2019t remember his rational but it seemed achievable so on 4 Jan I went live with my hinge account. I purposely chose hinge as I have anxiety around sending likes and receiving none back. Because of this anxiety and a tendency to be pathological I kept notes on my activity.\n\nOn the 4th of Jan I sent 2 likes with messages and got responses to both of them. 1 woman was 2 hours away and the other 1 hour. There was a lot I like about the woman who was an hour away, she had done a lot of work on herself and healing from past relationships, she was curious, passionate and used language that demonstrated emotional intelligence. She was also conventionally stunning, I remember thinking that she was probably out of my league. \n\nI asked her for a date on the 7th and we met halfway on the 10th. We walked and stopped for coffee and ended up spending around 4 hours together. Over the course of the date I told that I had been diagnosed with PTSD and shortly after the incidents that caused my PTSD I went into addiction. She was much more interested in what I was feeling emotionally at those times than what had happened and what I was doing. It felt like a really natural way to discuss it. She discussed her passions and some of her trauma and her journey to heal it. \n\nShe initiated a hug when we rapped up and said a bunch of nice things and that she would like to do it again. I was on a real high.\n\nOn the drive home I got incredibly triggered. I started having flashbacks of trauma, the PTSD trauma as well as childhood trauma. I got into a really dark place thinking if anyone knew everything that had happened to me that would never be able to see me as a worthy partner, they would just pity me. I was in a real spiral. I wanted to call her and tell her all my darkest traumas\u2026 at least I was able to see that thought for the madness it was.\n\nI arrived home and she had sent me a really lovely message saying how much she had enjoyed the date and she would like to do it again. In my triggered state I did way too much. I have a general rule of text that I only use 2 emojis ever which are \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude02 because I feel self conscious otherwise. I was using all the emojis and just couldn\u2019t contain myself.\n\nEmotionally I was going from elated thinking about the woman to complete despair thinking about how damaged I am. It was maybe the most triggered I had been in dating life since my hookups stage. \n\nWe had one more date but I couldn\u2019t tell my communication was concerning her. I could feel she wasn\u2019t that into it when we next met up and we didn\u2019t spend long together. I can imagine her position as well we have 1 pretty good date but I drop a lot of heavy stuff then she has this addict with a mental health diagnosis acting completely over the top trying to move to a relationship. \n\nShe sent me a really long, kind and clear message explaining that where she was at in her personal journey of healing she had realized she couldn\u2019t give herself to a relationship. I felt like I had definitely put to much pressure on her and I was honestly shocked with how easily I abandoned my curiosity to get to know her to just desperately wanting to be in a relationship with her. \n\nAgain, I had a real deep sense of relief when I got her \u2018it\u2019s not you it\u2019s me\u2019 message. I was disappointed but I had been really aware that I was doing too much. I had been unable to sit with a feeling whether positive or negative. There\u2019s a concept called emotional sobriety where you are comfortable being present with all of your feelings without any one of them defining or controlling you.\n\nI\u2019m aware of emotional sobriety. I practice mindfulness daily. All of this goes out the window when I have a strong feeling tho.\n\nI messaged her back to say that I understood and appreciated how clear and kind the message was. I also said just was grateful to have met her and thanked her for the space she held as it had been very easy to show up and be authentic and vulnerable. She did hit me back with a message along the lines of \u2018aw that\u2019s so sweet\u2019 so I deleted the message thread from my phone as I could feel the rumination coming on.\n\nI got triggered again when I saw she had unmatched me on hinge. I completely overhauled my profile to (what I imagine would) speak to a woman just like her. That was on the same day, I have since paused my account. No cyber stalking this time so some growth.\n\nI think dating and what it brings up for clearly shows me where I\u2019m at. Unfortunately where I\u2019m at is not where I want to be at. I want to be more healed. I have to accept where I\u2019m at tho. Acceptance will get me closer to healing.\n\nI think I\u2019m going to try my psychiatrists advice and go on a date a month. I need to be really aware that I am going to be triggered and that I will have to sit with my feelings if I am going to get the acceptance and intimacy I want. I  am worthy of love and self love is where it starts.\n\nI realize this might be more of a manic rant than a useful resource. The inspiration for this manic rant was the idea if I had just know that these emotions were possible or likely I could have perhaps sat with them and not had them control me at every turn. \n\nI\u2019m too tried to edit this atm but gonna post regardless as probably won\u2019t when I\u2019m rested.\n\nFinal thought, if this comes across as red pill or disrespectful to woman I will delete as its definitely not the intention. \n"

    "content": "I was raped as a teenager which has practically changed me overnight. Since then I've been fantasizing about raping, being raped, being humiliated, being tortured, etc. I feel absolutely disgusted every time I do this and it happens basically daily. I tried living in denial and with constant excuses and justifications of my thoughts. Outwardly I'm the complete opposite, when I'm not doing this I'm a creative, introspective, empathetic person who has talent and potential. But when I get aroused I turn into a monster.\n\nI've stopped living in denial because I met the most wonderful person I could ever meet. Shes a lot like me, sexual trauma and all, and I'm not sure if she has the same thing happen to her when she's aroused because we haven't opened up about it fully yet. But I do notice we both get incredibly kinky and rough while having sex and we have the tendency to feel immense guilt afterwards.\n\nThe thing that pains me is that when I feel myself get horny when she isn't here, the part of my brain gets switched on even harder than before I met her. Probably because I've been suppressing it. I'll spend an hour masturbating to the most disgusting and most degrading fantasies in which after I'll be so disgusted I feel like she should leave me.\n\nI'll get really graphic with my thoughts because I need this off my chest. Feel free to judge, you're only human. >!I often fantasize about getting anally raped to the point of internal and external bleeding. I fantasize about doing the same to others as well. Anything from drowning in cum, being raped by my family, having knifes plunged into my chest while being raped. Basically anything nonconsensual and violating!< \n\nI hate this so much and I'm afraid it'll cost me everything. But with arousal being a subconscious brain mechanism, and my association with sex being my first sexual experience (being raped by an older man), I feel like a slave to these urges. Sometimes you'll wake up horny before having the chance to even stop it. Sometimes you'll be caught totally off guard. Sometimes I'll see someone who looks like my abuser and I'll become a slave. It has only gotten worse. And I hate how the urge to go jerk off to rape fantasies is calling my name. I hate how it tells me that nobody has to find out. I hate how it tells me to do it in secret and lie to everyone. Because if I do that, I'll hear praise from my gf about how amazing of a person I am, and it genuinely breaks my heart knowing she has no idea I become a slave to the urge of another man raping me. If she told me she did the same thing, which based on the similarities of our personality is what i suspect; I'd feel incredibly relieved. But I'm scared to admit this in case she doesn't feel this way and I'll make her feel crushed.\n\nI'm going to emdr therapy soon, but what can I do in that time to help myself as much as I can? Does anybody have any success stories from something similar? I'd really appreciate hearing them"

It has actually taken some time to help him understand that being rough during sex is okay consensually.

When I\u2019m gone people will continue life as usual. Is this real? I think the real thing starts after death. I navigate life doing the things I think are expected out of me. But I hate all of it. I hate pretending like I\u2019m interested in the words coming out of the other peoples mouths. I hate being asked questions, I hate repeating myself. I wish people would pretend like I don\u2019t exist, I wish I could go unnoticed. I hate trying to be sympathetic/empathetic towards other peoples problems. I hate having to be the listening ear ,the problem solver. I don\u2019t understand any of it. I don\u2019t understand why people feel the way they do . I don\u2019t understand why people have such difficulty with what I think is minimal issues. I guess it\u2019s because I feel like no one understands me.

    "title": "Discovered my ex was a sadist, I made her lose her job by exposing her to her boss. I can't shake the pain off.",
    "content": "(This is a hardcore story of mine, be kind, don't judge me)\n\nI met her in February 2024. The day after I turned 30 years old.\n\nShe was 27yo asking for political signatures as her main job in the streets of the city. She was sweet and caring, dark humour and we vibed.\n\n2 weeks into getting to know each other I spent time with her. She told me she had an abusive father who was completely ostracized from her family. She also told me her previous exe's were abusive. She told me they isolated her, raped her, made threats of suicide if she didn't come back. She told me about her exe's wanting to kill her in the streets of her home town. Told me she had to carry scissors in her jacket.\n\nShe told me she was epileptic since age 13 because of a drowning incident. She told me her best friend (a guy) committed suicide in 2020 and she is now carrying a medallion in his memory. (I saw the guy's picture inside the medallion and also checked his social media accounts).\n\nAs the first two weeks passed I felt like I met an angel, the person I had waited for my whole life. Traumatic childhood just like me, lost my father and I also have an incurable medical condition...a match made in heaven.\n\nShe told me she liked domination, I thought she seemed very confident about her sexuality. Turns out she was outright telling me what was going to happen to me in the coming months in an inverted subtle way...\n\nShe told me she wasn't going to be here for long, claimed she needed to go back to her home town to get a new job there. I was disappointed of course and gave her confirmation that I was now \"binded\" to her. (I didn't know she was manipulative at the time of course...)\n\nA day after that statement she made, she wanted me to meet her male friend. I agreed since I'm not possessive and don't get overly jealous. As I shake the guy's hand in the pub we sit down and my \"girlfriend\" goes to the bar to order beers. I politely asked the guy friend what was my the nature of their relationship. The guy tells me \"it's for pleasure\" And boom, just like that she tried to \"use\" me or coerce me into having an unconsenting threesome. By using triangulation, cunning two people against each other, male competitiveness and so on she loved to see me anguish that night.\n\nI know I should have walked away and never talk to her again. But boredom of my life, might as well get to experience something and perhaps help this epileptic girl? Why would she spend her time to get to know me for two weeks straight?\n\nI stayed in the relationship for a total of four months.\n\nShe was a parasite, asking for money, favors, meals. She had two cellphones. She told me about cults late at night while I smoked weed and she didn't. I had been off from weed prior of meeting her. She reintroduced weed into my life because she claimed it would help her prepare for sodomy (something I didn't ask to do in the first place...)\n\nLate at night, while I thought she was being thoughtful and while I was on weed, I heard phrases like:\n\"tell me one good thing about your mother or father\"\n\n\"Your father who left you when you were four, do you think he loved you for abandoning you? Why are you still keeping in touch with him?\"\n\n\"I really feel sorry for you, it looks like your family didn't give you enough love\"\n\nFellow readers, if you had to ask these questions to your partner directly, what would be the intention or purpose?\n\nIsolation in progress, while she took advantage of my trust. I gradually stopped talking to my friends and family. I was also too damn busy fixing her curriculum and dealing with her horrible job and medical condition.\n\nOne day I had an eye infection and went to the ophthalmologist, there my eyes were spread open and held firmly tools. She was in the room because she wanted come along and support. When we got home she told me about a movie we should watch. She said it had a \"scene\" in it that I would like very much.\n\nTurned out the \"scene\" is a woman who goes to the ophthalmologist and gets her eyes openned by claws (very similar to what I experienced 2hrs before..) The lady gets her eyes burned by laser as she is unable to close her eyes. She dies horribly falling from the building, from the shock of impact, her burned eye rolled out on the road and ends up smashed by a car passing by. I paused the movie and saw that she was smiling. A smirk of satisfaction. I asked her: \"why are you showing me this?\" Her answer: \"I don't know \ud83d\ude0b\"\n\nScene: https://youtu.be/oJGlE1S99tw?si=POXCuPjthk1okcfS\n\nShe burned a dog who was resting between chairs on a terrace. She spilled the coffee on top of the dog as she was passing over him. I didn't know it was sadism at the time and the dog owners believed it was an accident. I know she saw the dog there and greeted him as she was about to order coffee. She saw that dog but yet was able to fucking trip over him and spilling hot coffee.\n\nShe flirted very subtly with men while humiliating me when I wanted to get physically romantic with her in public.\n\nShe introduced me her boss very early on into the relationship. I did tell her that it's not a very ethical thing to do but she didn't seem to care. So one day she asked me to go get her paycheck directly from the boss hands and I did it. Her boss was a witness of my devotion for her throughout the 4 months of this insane relationship.\n\nShe had a family of two sisters and a mother. The family was calling her frequently to see how she was doing... Or maybe to check if I was still breathing lol. I thought if the family is still supporting her then it's not hopeless.\n\nBut then one day she went too far at a bar and started to flirt way too much with a guy. She made sure her sentence mentioned her \"ass\" so that all the drunk guys would turn their heads. As one of them whispered something in her ear I knew the relationship was no longer sustainable.\n\nI called her sister the day of the breakup and explained the behaviors I saw and the things that she does. The sister called me insane and mental. She hung up on me. We broke up, she stalked me for a month by gravitating close to my apartment. She made sure id see her flirting with other men as I'd walk by.\n\nThen I typed \"narcissist\" on Google out of frustration. (She called her exe's narcissists) And to my shocking discovery I notice that narcissism is filled with images of a white \"mask\". A mask that I see is included my partners profile picture. All her social media has a picture of her with a mime in a costume wearing a white mask. She stands next to him making the heart shape with her hands.\n\nTurns out my whole relationship is based on a strategy, lies, deceit, profit, emtional rape, psychological torture and sadism.\n\nHer very first words when I met her \"I checked your Instagram to make sure you weren't a psychopath\"\n\nI realized that the medallion she was carrying was someone that she had pushed to suicide. I realized that all she told about her exe's and what they did to her had happened to me. I realized that she was a sadist and that she used love as a weapon to make me fall hard so she could better abuse me.\n\nUpon realizing that my girlfriend is a nymphomaniac sadist who could potentially give me HIV I panicked. The humiliation was so strong. I felt like jumping out of my apartment just to end the suffering.\n\nI spent a full week not sleeping nor eating. I left messages late at night to her boss who was probably witnessing weird shit from her as well. I knew it was immoral to do such a thing. I ended up calling the boss as I had been driven by ambulance to the hospital for suicide attempt.\n\nI told him everything on the phone. He told me I was the confirmation he needed. He explained to me that she was tyrannizing the whole team, humiliating them, belittling them, flirting with men, lying to create chaos between coworkers, making highly inappropriate sexual suggestions or innuendos. He told me she had sex with a coworker of mine.\n\nShe filed a complaint against me for calumny and death threats as I mentioned to her boss my will to kill her. No wonder all her exe's wanted to kill her.\n\nHer boss fired her about two weeks after we broke up. She was still stalking me at the time. Our last conversation at a caf\u00e9 near my apartment, she slapped my face and and threw water in my face in public as I was asking for an explanation for her mad ways...\n\nShe blocked me and disappeared never to be seen again. Her boss saw her a month later dragging a new insecure guy, likely her next victim, vulnerable people.\n\nObviously she just jumps from men to men while abusing them altogether.\n\nMoral of the story I dated an antisocial personality disorder individual. Her psychopathy was so high on the spectrum that she needed domination and sadism in order to feel good about herself. She cannot attach to any living thing. She will hurt anyone, even her family or the family's dogs.\n\nIt is extremely scary to come across such an individual. It made me grow up but I feel like I've been given a glimpse of what should never be seen. Her torture movies, the lip sewing while the lady screamed. The sadistic pleasure of seeing someone in pain. The proudness of having killed someone and wearing a medallion as a trophy. Knowing that she's a dead man's trap.\n\nShe doesn't feel remorse for what she did to me or other living beings before me. I do feel remorse for contributing into her getting fired. I feel like I had no choice, I believe she wanted to deceive me and hurt me so fucking hard I'd kill myself. Like in ww1 germans used gas, so what did the french end up doing? retaliating with gas. I became like that but I had no choice. She wanted confrontation because it makes her feel good. A very sad wasted life."

    "content": "I can't help but automatically assume that that narrative I believed firmly in my head is true - that I'm innately inept and the lowest of the low. That I'm subhuman, and undeserving to even go outside and be in the presence of other people. That I deserve to die. That I deserve to rot in a room, but not even that. That just like when I was 13, I deserve death because of how badly of a person I was, for whatever reason.\n\nI guess my 13 year old self thought that because I couldn't attend school that I was a bad person. Something had to have been wrong with me because I wasn't like other kids - not like the other girls, specifically. I wished I had a boyfriend. Before I stopped going, the girls left me out and I had no friends. No boys looked at me or talked to me. One female was mean to me. She was new like me and got friends but I didn't. I almost attacked her. That was when I told myself I was bad and dangerous and that it was a breaking point. \n\nI had been suicidal and was having thoughts of fighting other females - so thoughts of harming others. That's when I knew I had an issue and took my own self out of school. I told my mom any and every promise and lie I could to get her to put me in home school, not knowing I had underlying ADHD.\n\nWhen I finally got homeschooled, I couldn't focus on work, and instead self taught unknowingly, but considered myself a giant failure who deserved death even more so.\n\nI turned to my mother for help, but she denied any problem. Sometimes she told me that I had an issue in myself. A secret moral conflict that I should ask God for forgiveness for. Sometimes I believed her, other times not. I equated this to her killing me. She was the only person who could do something about my situation. She denied my feelings. She told me they were my fault, validating only the narrative that I was an evil person who deserved death. In south Dakota, because we moved a lot, you had to have your parents consent to get treatment for mental health.\n\nAnd so I sat, for 5 years. Chronically suicidal, and crying only with emojis, having the internet digitally wipe my tears for me. I wasted away inside a trashed bedroom - neglected, wearing the same clothes, my hair in knots, and having not showered for a month, believing there was absolutely no hope and that my dreams were dead at age fucking 15.. 13.. 14, whatever.\n\nEven the slightest thing will tell me that I'm back there in the isolation as that person who is subhuman, worthless, deserves to die, so disgusting...\n\nI believed it for so long and that's why I get triggered so easily. It sends me back there again, too. It always feels like I'm there again, I've realized. I've realized it all started from this. This is a giant realization for me. A starting point for my future therapist. Thanks for whoever reads this.\n\n******\n\nAfter 18, well, I left to be on the streets because I couldn't stand being inside or my mom's house. Unfortunately the world was cold and ate me alive and I got addicted to Methamphetamine. I wanted to fit in so bad. I've been trying to quit for almost five years. I've been on it for three years straight. Recently been making a lot of progress recently with new medication on board \ud83e\udd79. \n\nGot back from a narcotics anonymous meeting not too long ago. I've never felt more free in my life. That says a lot considering I'm addicted to intravenous methamphetamine. My dreams are alive and well today I can be whatever I want to be and do whatever I want with my life. Hope exists today.\n\nMy mom is much more healthy, as am I. We have a better relationship today."

The work was so difficult and the server assistant position wasn't worth it at all, as we were weren't treated kindly by most manager (minus one bless his heart). I had gotten put back to silverware rolling due to my complications with blackouts and seizures. A lot of which people barely believe me on, though he did, but I've finally got them under control now. People will say what they will, but I started to work with an older gentleman, Bob I believe his name is I'm can't remember much else.

Though I wore a small pride bracelet and one day he asked me if there was a lot of us around here. I wasn't sure how he meant it at first so I didn't jump immediately to any conclusion. As time passed I kept talking to him as he never said anything rude and we worked well together, always chatting. Then he one day finally told me a bit about his life and told me he was an gay veteran, had a best friend he had lost years ago. So he had a temper and could get jumpy which I understood and always talked again with him. Just enjoying hearing his life story. Then one day the managers had made him be a server assistant. I couldn't believe it especially because I was only 20 at the time and it about broke me down. That day he got done, sat his tub down and had begun gagging from how over worked he was. I watched him run out to the trash cans and I quickly followed to see if he was okay, asked him and sat with him. Eventually he cooled down and told me he hasn't had anyone in over 20-30 years ask him if he was okay. I was the only, even that day no one went to check on him other then me. \nWhen I went through rough times he tried so hard to help get my job back, but I wasn't able to. I will never forget his effort for me, and I am glad I heard his story. I just know times are so hard now so I keep my best to try to be as kind as I can when I know it's for the right reason. The small things matter so much to some and this was one of those moments. And well if you got this far thank you! I just wanted to share a moment of support I got to share with someone I didn't expect too, and am glad I did. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc3e"

I\u2019m hyper vigilant, can\u2019t relax, extremely depressed, so lonely, and keep experiencing unwanted thoughts. I don\u2019t know what to do and this is really severe. Do I go to a hospital?

    "title": "How Can I help my friend with PTSD have more insight and acceptence?  TW Suicide, Self Harm and Violence all mentioned but not graphically",
    "content": "Throw away account for this as my friend knows my usual username\n\n**Trigger Warning this post mentions not graphically Domestic Violence, Suicide and Self Harm**\n\nLooking how I can help said friend. For context we\u2019re in the UK but this is about helping her accept so she can move forwards so happy to hear from anyone all over the world.\u00a0\n\nMy friend (35/F) is the sweetest, loveliest kindest woman you will ever meet. She\u2019d literally give you her last \u00a3 if she saw you struggling. She buys food for the homeless, she gives to food banks and other charities, she has previously volunteered in schools and nurseries reading with children and helping with trips. She is quite literally perfect if you meet her day to day.\n\nBut she has a massive flaw. She refuses to accept her Mental Health and it\u2019s affecting her life badly.  \nShe has two children (Both female, aged 9 and 7) who are currently in Foster Care due to her lack of insight into her MH. They have been there for coming up to 18 months now, she wants them home but will not give any acceptance to her MH and until she does I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll get her children home. The children where generally well cared for, but where a little bit babied and my friend struggled with their behaviour in the 6 months before they were taken off her; nothing hugely bad but she struggled to say no, there where times friend would be very disorganised and the children would go to school or groups without things they needed like a jumper or their PE kit (not massive issues but show her not coping), she relied far too much on takeaways when stressed, would stop washing their clothes and just buy new if the washing piled up etc. but it was starting to affect the childrens behaviour in school so it was decided by Social Services, School and my friend that the children should go into foster care while she got herself sorted out \u2013 she sees them 5 times a week including once over the weekends and is allowed to take them out unsupervised. She has no family as they all cut her off when she left her husband as they said she messed up her marriage and must face the consequences alone.\n\nShe has experienced Domestic Abuse and most likely violence from her childrens father but she refuses to accept it, says it didn\u2019t happen and on the rare occasion she says she deserved it and made him do those things to her; she has a scar on her wrist I strongly suspect her gave to her, and another similar one on her shoulder \u2013 I met her after they split. There is a court order preventing him having any contact with any of them (hence the FC instead of them going to him), which makes her being isolated from family all the worse \u2013 her family don\u2019t believe she was abused because she doesn\u2019t act like she was according to them, she\u2019s very quiet, private about her life and just wants to keep her head down and get on with it.\n\nShe\u2019s had help to get on top of things in the home, but feels very self-conscious about it so won\u2019t have things like a routine on her walls/doors to help her with organisation which SS say show no insight into moving forward and improving.\n\nShe\u2019s had some courses via Women\u2019s Aid (Domestic Violence Charity in the UK) but found it unhelpful as she said she didn\u2019t fit in with the women there as they\u2019ve all experience real Domestic Violence unlike her. She didn\u2019t feel any sort of connection with any of the women who all seemed to make friends and she was glad when both courses where over.\n\nHer CPN (think it\u2019s Community Psychiatric Nurse \u2013 she\u2019s with the local MH team but not part of her GP surgery or anything) organised some therapy both 1-1 and group for trauma victims but she found neither helpful. Says the therapist just wanted to talk about her marriage and when friend told her that they split because others believe he was violent the therapist kept asking her for examples of the violence and she couldn\u2019t think of any then she didn\u2019t want to talk to the therapist so just did each session without contributing anything personal so it was very much a textbook type thing where the therapist tried to get her to do breathing exercises and think about her feelings which she says made her feel stupid and like a naughty school girl. She felt out of place in the group setting again because she felt she hadn\u2019t experience trauma or had a reason to say she did so she sat there in silence \u2013 when she was given an excuse to not go friend didn\u2019t go which is apparently unusual as most people want to go back after a few sessions in the group setting.\n\nHer CPN has that friend doesn\u2019t seem to know why she has to see the CPN \u00a0and is in total denial about her MH and how bad it is. According to Social Services reports she\u2019s diagnosed with PTSD, Social Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. However she is low risk for self-harm and suicide as did the therapist for the 1-1. She is also low risk of harming others, probably because she\u2019s so indenial about her conditions.\n\nSocial Services have said she needs to have some insight into her MH to be able to fully sort herself out because if she doesn\u2019t then the risk is too great of harm coming to her children so they cannot return to her.\n\nAs I said she\u2019s the loveliest, sweetest, kindest woman you\u2019ll ever meet but completely shut off when it comes to herself. She blames herself for every little thing and Social Services have noted this too, so when her elder daughter fell at school and hurt her knee she blamed herself saying she\u2019d not warned her daughter to be careful at school that morning, similarly her younger daughter has a perfectly normal accident while at a playground where she fell and broke her arm, friend took appropriate action by taking her to the hospital where it was put in a cast which her daughter loved but friend blames herself saying she should have been standing under her daughter as she climbed the steps on the slide (she fell off the side and snapped her wrist when trying to stop herself falling \u2013 perfectly normal childhood accident that any child could have even the hospital said this!).\n\nSo how can I help her? I love her, she\u2019s like a sister to me and her children are my nieces but I know she needs to have this insight. I want her children to be back at home with her, where they want to be, but I know she needs to accept her MH is poor and try to improve it to be able to. Anything I can suggest? Even if that is to the CPN or Social Services."

From there on his jobs and story\u2019s have gotten worse. \n     He was in the army during all the Middle East stuff. He was a medic so he constantly saw horrific stuff. Such as people missing limbs/blown up, people getting shot, mass graves, unloading trucks full of body\u2019s, smelling and dealing with full body burn victims. There\u2019s tons of stuff I could list off but I assume you all get the point. \n     He then got out of the army and started working medical in a prison. All day it was people getting violently beat, stabbed, raped. He would show me pictures of cell floors COVERED in blood. \n     After working medical he then transitioned to custody, which is the actual prison guards. He has been assaulted, and has had to fight inmates. A job like that makes you stressed and alert all day for 10 hours a day.

He seems to be stressed and nervous all day even when he\u2019s just sitting around. He thinks everyone is out to get him and that everyone is a threat to him and his family. Any little thing can make him snap. He tried cooking breakfast, dropped the pan and lost it. Today the neighbors dog was barking and instead of talking to the neighbors he wanted to grab a BB gun and shoot the neighbors window. I don\u2019t see how anyone would think that\u2019s a good idea. It wasn\u2019t ever like this. He has always been a super sweet person and he\u2019s a great dad and husband.

I might possibly (hopefully not but) post here a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was diagnosed officially a while ago. But I've known I had PTSD quite likely since the age of 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was, and for most of my life so far, subjected to severe sexual abuse, and abuse in all forms imaginable, and then gaslit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was also surrounded by stand-by-ers, liars, and by people who protected the abusers all in different ways and thereby ensured that the abuse would continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI said in all forms: sexually, verbally, mentally, psychologically, materially, financially, exploited for gain, socially and physically and beyond more.\n\n\n\nThese abusers also kidnapped me or had me kidnapped. Multiple times.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm more than brave enough to post this now though I'm not sure exactly why. Perhaps knowing that, as protectively selfish as I can sometimes be, someone out there is suffering as much as I am.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sheer hysteria, as I called it, and extreme distress was seemingly triggered not only by the nightmares and the subsequent-physical-body-sleep-refusal, but the physical breaking of a few of my belongings today.\n\n\n\n\n\nA few of my things got broken. And I am, even now, too exhausted to go out and find replacements for them. I'm too dead to cry, too sleepless to go outside, too numb to function, all at once.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut let me say: the day needed to come where I write all this down, and I didn't know it would be now and it would be here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands of us suffer, and at the same time we feel alone, and at the same time we often want to be alone. I know I certainly value my solitude. And often, my independence I rank higher than all else.\n\n\n\n\nI am so lucky to have a supply of clean water and a bottle to put it in. I drank some of it and took one long, deep breath. I still feel awful. Awful and numb at once.\n\n\n\n\n\nI cope by writing songs and poems and long stories which capture almost the exact things I was subjected to while I was a literally tortured child.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost all my writing is PTSD-based, PTSD-fueled, nightmare-inspired and memory-crafted. I tend to post my songs online, and on a \"scheduled\" automatic basis.\n\n\n\n\n\nI normally don't fall apart while *in the middle of* writing songs but today I absolutely did. I still mostly blame the physical-self-protection-hypervigilance-survival-refusal to sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI still have a few self-harm tendencies. But by the grace of God (please replace these concepts with those of your choice to fit what you, the reader, believe) and karma and the universe, my tendencies towards self-harm are genuinely so much less than what they were ten years ago; when I was 17.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI turn 28 later on this year. I have accomplished so much; at times, it feels like so little. It feels that way sometimes. It does, and when it does, I hate it. I have a path in front of me. Just like we all do. And we all have to walk it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm staring at a screen now to write a message like this but today is when these words had to come out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm a writer, so love or hate me for a long post if you must. All that matters is that I did write it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake the hurt a tool to turn you into the best version of you and not into a monster, because the world already has too many of those.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's gonna keep hurting but we made it this far for a reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep on fighting every single day, my fellow survivors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr(?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere really isn't one"

This couldn't be any further from the truth, I even have him 80% of the time and treat him amazingly!\n\nI recently got remarried and it's been very hard for my son, but it's especially hard because my ex is working even harder to keep my son's PTSD of me leaving the family alive and healthy, despite our son going to therapy now to work through it. \n\nWhenever my son is upset, he goes into a rage and panic attack about how I'm leaving him, how I no longer love him and want nothing to do with him, etc. One time I made the mistake of bringing up a little trip I went on to a friend's birthday out of state during his time with his dad. He had another panic attack about how I've left him and that it's proof I never want to be with him and that he should just stay with Dad forever. However, I specifically went on this trip during his dad's time so my son would never even notice I was gone that weekend!\n\nIt even bleeds into daily conversation.

I've done everything I possibly can to cater to my son and his PTSD that \u201dI'm leaving/have left the family.\" I've proven my son's entire life that I'm not leaving him and it feels like the situation isn't improving at all. What else can I do?? I need tools and advice on how to cope with this, please!"

The switch happened after getting out of a relationship with a narcissist (I think he was, he was not diagnosed). We were both unkind to each other, but there is a big difference between the things he said and did and didnt do. I also had a traumatic injury that he was selfish while I was in icu.

    "content": "I'll start by apologizing if I won't be able to express myself 110%, but I'm Italian and not exactly familiar with more specific technical terminology. \n\nI have been treated for about 7 years with cognitive behavioral therapy and EMDR, I have a partial diagnosis of borderline disorder resulting in depression and a history mainly based on a sense of guilt and insecurity, linked to parental figures (and para-parental ones, like my uncle /brother, having only 15 years difference, who completely replaced the father figure during my father's shortcomings). \n\nMy mother is the most important person in my life, in childhood she was violent to the extent that a mother from the 90s is who responds to crying with a slap, also a victim of a family that raised her in this way, it led me to become her mental caregiver in giving her \"as little trouble as possible\". She worked her whole life to give me everything and redeem herself from her father. I always saw my family as me and her even when my father was still with us.\n\nMy father is a gambling addict with a clear narcissistic gray area resulting from a possible trauma that made him dramatically childish and self-centred and consequently take on his responsibilities with anyone (after the separation with my mother he always used me as an implicit messenger of his being a good person, making nice, fatherly gestures towards me just to prove something to my mother). He never tried to teach me anything, putting everything on my mother\u2019s shoulders, even if she was working night and day on developing her company and have enough money for all of us.\n\nMy uncle, when I was growing up, due to the loss of his mother at a very young age (21 years old) and the consequent transfert of the maternal figure in my mother, was a constant and very important figure in my life who built 90% of my personality, stimulating my actual passions and ambitions. even if he was \u201cmy hero\u201d, very often I took part to conversations without filters and naivety (as if I was an adult as him) when it comes to discussions about sex that, in particular during puberty fueled this mythologizing of the sex world.\n\nIn 2020, during a psychotherapy session I innocently \"confess\" to my therapist that up until the age of 15 (when I firmly began to oppose it), my father used to kiss me on the mouth (passionate kisses, with his tongue ) and \"tenderly\" stuck his tongue in my ear, believing these were normal things fathers do, no?\n\nMy therapist, although it wasn't the first time I talked about this dynamic, on that occasion made me understand about a potential dynamic of \"physical\" abuse from my father, as well as \"psychological\" on the part of the other two key figures of my life that made me constantly self doubting about reality and live without a fair point of reference in my life. \n\nI rack my brain for two years, despairing because I can\u2019t remember or recall any actual memory of an actual abuse but only detached pieces (burnings in my genitals, games with a profoundly sexual nature during my 5-6 years old) and I also start to tell myself that maybe this never happened and I'm exaggerating. \n\nIn all of this I experience a distorted sexuality made of extreme voracity of hard experience and desire for humiliation, swingers clubs and very dangerous encounters that my therapist reads as \"passive suicides\" combined with alcohol and substance abuse (of course).\n\nHowever, I managed to move forward very well in my career and in my life, quitting alchool and drugs to resolve myself just enough and meet the man who would later become my husband, the man of my life and perfect teammate despite his very deep traumas and with whom we are still doing a psychological journey as a couple to resolve ourselves together before thinking of having children (as our parents perhaps should have done before having us, but those were different times). \n\nThe problem is the following: we cannot have a peaceful sexuality. \nWe are very strong in everything: work, home, family, planning. \nWe love each other infinitely, there is great intimacy and tenderness but we are no longer able to have sexual relations with each other. He knows that I like a more aggressive type of sexuality, I know that he seeks a tenderness in sex that has never been part of the \"things I like\" in sex. \n\nI'm starting to think that it depends a lot on that missing piece of my story, also because after an enormous sexual voracity that has always characterized my life to the point of making me more than precocious in my experiences, since I reached certain awareness with therapy I\u2019m not attracted to sex anymore, except when I happen to drink and dissociate (increasingly rarely). \n\nDo you have similar studies/advice/therapy/experiences to share? \nI'd like to feel less alone in this :) \n\nThank you"

I haven't really ever spoken about my trauma (I don't want to, it makes my family look bad) but recently I was talking about it for the first time to my therapist about it and I started experiencing really bad depersonalization. My current therapist has not had and probably will not have enough time to evaluate me, as I just started with her AND my insurance is changing at the end of the month to one that she can't take. I am getting a new therapist soon though. At my next therapist, should I bring up the depersonalization and the severity of it, even if it's only happened once? As with all disorders, PTSD requires some consistency with symptoms, so I'm not sure if this counts. I've only spoken in depth about my trauma (in English*) one time, and that was the time I had that depersonalization episode. Should I still mention depersonalization as a symptom during eval?\n\n*I'm bilingual. I speak English and French. When I speak about my trauma in French (my second language), it feels a lot less \"emotionally heavy\" and I can speak about it with fewer problems. It doesn't cause an episode of any kind.

I had a nagging feeling on the way there that I was gonna have a bad time, just like the first 2 gatherings that upset me for other reasons....and I was right, about everything.\n\nI got straight up NOTHING but gutterballs over and over again, making myself look like a dumbass in front of everyone while they all got strikes and  spares with barely any gutters.\n\n(No one asked for bumpers and I don't feel right using them cause it feels babyish imo, if I got a strike with them it wouldn't feel like I actually did anything)\n\nSomeone jokingly said I was on a roll with all the zeros I was building up on the screen on my losing streak, which set me off even more internally while I tried my absolute hardest to keep it together without seething or bursting into tears.\n(I know she didn't say it to be mean, a lot of people there are just really peppy/extroverted and don't know how to read the room.)\n\nI started getting extremely frustrated and I ended up rage quitting around the end of the first game.

Do I allow them to give into those urges through me, knowing full well they will be cared for and respected, and this isn't our first rodeo?

Stress tolerance is going up again...\nThis was a lot of work and stress I put me in to keep me going back to \"normal\".

    "content": "Okay so there's a lot to unpack, there is also a lot of SA in my past and my dad was very verbally abusive as well, but I want to maybe get your opinion on other kinds of situations.\n\nMy dad was very abusive even at home, many times I was just so scared and my mom was holding the door so he didn't get to me. I was always totally terrified not knowing what is gonna happen in the next few seconds. Will she manage to hold the door? What if not? What will happen then? Will I die? He would eventually calm down but then he would get another wave of rage and it would rinse and repeat - so I never knew when it is really over. I think that is why I don't feel safe till I really know for sure the issue is in the past. I also totally hate hearing people walking or talking behind the door of my apartment etc :))\n\nI also remember him beating my mom. And he got to me a few times too. I remember once we were out skiing, I was having a snow glider. I was little. And I accidentally let the strap slip from my hands and the glider.... glided away lol. He got upset that I am ungrateful and the only thing I remember afterwards is that I was flying in the air after the glide lmao.\n\nAnother thing is that once my mom was not home and he called me for a lunch. I did not hear because I was playing my guitar. Then he came in raging, threw the guitar away and I just remember being on the floor. I don't know what he was doing but I knew I was curled up and taking some hits. You know when you are kinda disconnected so you don't feel as much, you just feel the slow warmth from the punches spilling over your body. Ringing in ears from the hits and so. Then he started walking away. And I wanted to get up. But that triggered him. So I just knew I have to keep being still so it doesn't repeat itself. There is quite a sad thing I realised recently - what I felt because he was usually calling me pretty bad names, and then praised me in front of people, because he had the need to look perfect for others. While I was just lying there not moving, I felt shame. Shame that I must look so ugly lying like that on the floor. That my limbs are positioned in an ugly way. That I am just puffy and red and gross and pathetic because I am crying. I wanted to at least maybe wipe my snot, so I don't look so bad in front of him. But I could not move. Because then he would start it again. I was feeling shame that I am not good enough for him after he abused me. And that I am not a pretty victim...\n\nAnyway now to the most recent thing. It was happening quite often that he would get angry while driving. I kinda remember mainly one incident. Him driving. My mom next to him. Me on the back seat. He got upset and started shouting and speeding. And telling us how we are c\\*nts and wh\\*res and bi\\*ches and he is gonna kill us all. I just remember being so scared. Totally frozen on the back seat because I was afraid that if he catches my face in the back mirror, he will not like it and it will anger him even more and he will crash the car. I did not even want to breathe or blink. I was really afraid that I will move one inch and he will steer the car. At the same time I felt like I was on fire. Again, I know it was happening quite frequently, but one of them I remember quite clearly.\n\nAnd situations like this kept happening on a regular basis, I would have more problems figuring out when there were actually ok moments. Lmao some people say that children look towards their parents as they are gods. I never related to it. Because I guess if you pray to god, you pray for love and happiness and good stuff. I felt like I was praying for my life. So if he was a god for me, then it must have been a god of death.\n\nAnd I think related to this... I also realised why I have issues \"leaving\" conflict? I know rationally that when I get upset or when I am triggered by something, I should leave and take it easy and navigate situation when I am calmer. But there comes point when I cannot even think and the thought that I have the option to leave is nowhere to be found. I also really HATE public transport. I always sit in the front seat. Or by the door. If I am stuck somewhere by the window and it is full of people, I get almost panicky because I feel like I cannot escape and I am trapped. It happens on buses and trains too. I hate that I cannot feel fresh air - one thing I really do not appreciate about modern trains lol. I do get into cars but when people start driving a little bit too fast for me (which doesn't have to be fast at all), I am getting uncomfortable. \n\nI was assesed for PTSD but they told me I do not have it because I do not have ONE flashback or a nightmare to which I am returning to. I mean but the topics are quite similar. It is always being trapped, not having a say in the situation and having my autonomy taken away. My nightmares would usually involve me being - again, trapped. In my childhood house. Many times I would be running away and jumping from the windows. Hoping to catch the bus and escape without him knowing where I am. Or knocking on the doors of neighbours and feeling hopeless because it takes them so long and he will get me. \n\nI think all I am asking is to know if I am unreasonable for thinking they may have underestimated it?"

Before I went up the stairs I saw handcuffs Dangling from the ceiling that were open, so I knew somebody escaped. When I went upstairs there a man told me to sit down and put this weird tape on me kinda like the black stuff from the movie venom. It was some kind of compliance tape. Before he put it on me, I screamed and yelled for my wife, to come save me. After he put the tape on he asked me personal questions like what I was doing, where I was going, where do I live etc. then my wife came down and saved me we ran upstairs and drove away. \n\n\nWhen I woke up I was sweating and could barely move out of fear my heart was beating fast and I was scanning my dark room for someone.

It is greatly effecting my ability to do even fairly simple work. I have also been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder, so it explainsy brain being foggy and slow sometimes, but these problems persist even when I feel perfectly clear.

I wish I didn\u2019t get out because I loved being a marine. My job was easy without the toxic coworkers and leadership. PTSD completely ruined me to the point I became toxic.

I didn't have anything illegal on me, and I wasn't doing anything wrong, but still, I was incredibly paranoid.  I kept looking in my mirrors until I was a good mile away.\n\nAnd then I worked on processing what had happened using the CBT techniques we had just gone over during my therapy session, which led me to realize my fear is based in mistrust of authorities after being betrayed by authorities I had trusted.\n\nIdk.  Anyone else get this?"

    "content": "I\u2019ve seen people who have been to war, raped, sexually, physically, and mentally abused by the adults in their life, the people that they love or hate. What I went through was bad and may be seen as somewhat traumatic to some, I guess, but my body reacts like it was a serious trauma. I have the flashbacks and the nightmares. I\u2019ll have days where I\u2019ll suddenly remember it only once or not at all, and days at a time where the memory\u2019s will just come to me multiple times a day. I\u2019ll start hyperventilating and get dizzy, and then I get afraid I\u2019m going to pass out and wake up in the hospital, and then causes me to freak out even more and freeze up. And then I\u2019m super agitated for no reason and then I feel bad later for being mean to people. I have doctor\u2019s appointments more than your average Joe (schizophrenia). Luckily the therapy, EMDR, and psychiatry are all in completely different areas. Except my neurology appointment. It\u2019s the same hospital. I need to go to get refills for my epilepsy medication twice a year. I think the people there assume I\u2019m rude. The nurses and front desk are at first friendly and polite, and I\u2019m usually an extroverted happy upbeat person but when I go there I completely shut down, I\u2019m slower, my voice for some reason won\u2019t change, it will be like this flat tone with no inflection. They usually very quickly change how they treat me. Im guessing I\u2019m showing no emotion either. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m sad or anything, it\u2019s just like the fear set off so many alarm bells that my brain just went capoot stopped working. What helps though is I have this really cute palm sized stuffed animal that I have on my desk. It\u2019s a cute ghost, in an egg shape with a zipper, and when you unzip it there\u2019s a little cute smiling baby bat inside XD. If something suddenly comes up I just talk with them. If the world starts to spin I talk with them about my day. When I go to doctor\u2019s appointments I bring them with me. Sometimes if it\u2019s a bad day but I want to leave the dorm, I bring them with me and we explore the city together :). I feel embarrassed bringing them to class (even if they stay in my backpack and nobody knows about them). Plus I feel bad because they\u2019re stuck in class with me. Plus I feel like I have to go to the bathroom all the time an hour or two before bed because I get so scared about having a nightmare. And I have sharp back pain that developed from sleeping in the beds (they were hard plastic block. The \u201cmattress\u201d that I had had nothing in it so I was lying on the hard plastic block and they refused to give me another mattress. I got back pain so bad so couldn\u2019t stand and my nerves got caught in my rib cage making it so I couldn\u2019t move. The flashbacks also subconsciously cause me to make noise, faces, and jerk my head. "

    "content": "\\-insight from 5 years of focused PTSD recovery after witnessing my fianc\u00e9e take his own life/ years of abuse\n\n\\-this isn't a guide by any means, simply my own experience trying to live with PTSD\n\n\n\nI felt prompted to write this out after seeing a post about why trauma survivors shouldn't meditate by typical definitions. The post resonated with me on an incredibly deep level and took me back to right after my big trauma event, and the healing path I went on. Like many others facing suffering I was advised to meditate on what I was struggling with, a kind suggestion that had viscerally opposite effects on me at that stage in my healing. I felt frustrated and convinced that I was simply just doing it wrong, as I had seen firsthand the wonderful results of long-term meditation. Still I persisted, and began listening to guided meditations from Plum Village.\u00a0\n\nIt was not until I heard one monk state how it is not necessary to remain still, to allow natural twitches and physical response to flow through you during meditation, that my efforts started to feel like it was actually doing something different within me. I let go of the notion that my meditation had to be in the sitting position, as the little twitches I was told to not ignore would often bring me to very physically expressive motions, and it was in those moments of movement that I felt the ease so many others described getting from traditional sitting meditation. The practice of aimlessness became my go-to for grounding in difficult situations. What had been characterized as pacing my entire life became re-defined. With my body and senses engaged in the world around me I would begin to sift through the cacophony of debris stuck inside my head. I had so many unprocessed memories waiting for their chance to be understood in my short term memory bank. Through aimlessness I was able to begin letting them arise in my mind and follow the train of thoughts and feelings that the memories evoked.\n\nI was re-introduced to the flow arts around this time in my healing journey (something I had only ever known as a fun and visually stimulating activity you see at festivals or in performance) and picked up poi.\u00a0\n\n\\[For people unfamiliar with flow props - poi is a ball at the end of a rope/string, typically utilized in a set of two\\]\u00a0\n\nI made my first pair out of some cord knotted at both ends with a tennis ball over one of the knots. Holding them felt right, like a security blanket. I took no traditional guidance in learning popular tricks, opting to just swing them around wildly in ways that seemed fit. I began carrying them with me everywhere I went, fidgeting with them almost constantly and in times of stress pausing what I was doing all together to step back and spin them in the patterns that had become familiar. The comfort felt while engaging in these practices compelled me to explore more activities of this nature, as poi had become a habit I would indulge in constantly - often being up throughout the night practicing the motions until dawn. Though I must clarify, it was not the activity keeping me up, trauma had long sense rendered me unable to sleep through the night, often only achieving rest once exhaustion was met. Flow gave me something to occupy that time with something that made me feel different, and better yet sped up the exhaustion process which resulted in me finally being able to get some sort of regulated rest back into my cycle.\n\nAt some point or another it clicked in my head that the physical exertion was beneficial to easing my suffering, and I became addicted to chasing that high (this is the language I would use with myself about the situation, as it felt like a guilty pleasure to find inner healing and growth. A form of self-deprecation that allowed my traumatized pattern of thought to slowly fight itself out). I restructured my life around being able to be physically active, bringing my poi with me to work and spending all my free time either at the gym or flowing in my backyard. I got physically strong as a result and discovered a feeling of self-pride and confidence that I had never known. My physical appearance was not the centerpiece of this pride either, but the confidence that I was capable of making changes in my life for the better.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, I felt the urge to expose myself to strangers and meet new people (I had kept myself secluded to only groups of people that were familiar with my trauma and capable of handling my outbursts). I had something I was passionate about that finally wasn't just obsessing over the life altering experiences I had gone through. Even if it was just a step away from the trauma and often led conversation back in that direction, it was different and that was good. Talking to people felt foreign, like learning a language for the first time. I had countless failures, but I grew to learn that these interactions would not hurt me like my anxiety anticipated. It felt freeing to disagree and to disappoint while staying true to myself and being genuine with others.\n\nMaking my first friend after the incident taught me so much, namely that there was so much more to who I was than the trauma that consumed my existence. I was not just some \u201cthing\u201d that these events had happened to, I was an entire individual that had been a person before and continue to be a person after. Having someone want to know who I was felt transforming, and daunting. For a time I was convinced I needed to create a \u201cfixed\u201d personality to introduce to people to be accepted. My outbursts transformed into an almost performative display, masked by things I had discovered could be expressed in polite company. I operated like this for a while, slowly rebuilding my understanding of strangers, leaving room to dismantle so much of the fear that had ruled my existence during and after the trauma.\u00a0\n\nOne of the changes I had experienced immediately after my event was a drastic change in perspective of what was important to me. Things that so often vexed me before seemed trivial compared to the big picture, like a switch had been shut off to caring about these things as a whole if it wasn't solution oriented (Don't like what you have to eat? -Get something you do like. Need money? -Shoot for careers that meet your needs. Person upsetting you? -Tell them and find common ground. Have a crush? -Confess it to them. Taxes? -Just file them and see what happens\u2026etc). This mentality clashed heavily with the majority of strangers I came to interact with, but it was my perspective and continued to let it dictate my input into interactions I had. Part of me desperately wanted to care about such seemingly small things again, and so I would practice and allow myself to fall into situations that would typically evoke these \u201csmaller\u201d feelings in a safe environment I felt I could control.\n\nIt was not at all a speedy transition from forcing myself to experience little guaranteed let downs to letting myself cusp the idea of being happy. I came to recognize that the feeling of elation was far more uncomfortable to me than I anticipated. Seeing as it was ultimately the goal, it came as a depressing shock to find my body responding in ways I can only characterize as rejection. I often denied the possibility of feeling happy, for when I was experiencing it even if it was slight, my body would react negatively. I didn't trust that what I felt was happiness, because why would being happy feel so wrong? I did a lot of reading during this point in my growth, and I stumbled across the sentiment that happiness often feels \u201cwrong\u201d when a person has amassed a majority of negative experiences and feelings. Regardless of its supposed \u201cgood\u201d nature, happiness was not a regular response of my body. I felt more comfortable in an anxiety induced state of sickness than I did enjoying a genuinely positive experience. My body was scared to feel good.\n\nThis realization hammered in the notion that the body and mind experience things separately even though they work in tandem. It seemed like such a \u201cduh\u201d moment of connecting the dots as to why I had seen greater improvement when I was focusing on my physical body. This encouraged me to focus less on what I thought would evoke happiness of mind (something I still viscerally struggled to accept within) and reconnect with the feelings my body would express. The majority of my physical journey had involved pushing myself to extremes, overcoming hurdles, and an overall sense of overstimulation. Even the state of meditation I was able to achieve was only reachable when physically activating all parts of my body ( I had invested in a yoga hammock so that I could flip myself upside down in the air, keeping my entire body focused on not dropping on my head allowed the thoughts within it to flow). I was stressing my body out to achieve \u201crelaxation\u201d.\n\nI didn't feel worthy of being allowed to experience simple physical happiness. How could I when I couldn't even achieve such base good feelings like being well rested or well fed? In learning to let good physical responses in, I unearthed many more traumas that had unknowingly faded into the foundation of who I was. Each one, when discovered, needed its own space to express and understand itself before being able to transform. As a whole I felt unfixable, but these realizations did not pop up all at once, and beginning to tackle them as they arose felt more and more manageable once I got the first few under my belt.\n\nEasing into gentler exercises I began flowing with a hoop as my prop, in my eyes it was much simpler, more room for error than poi. Spinning and learning to hoop was delightful in such new ways. I compared myself less to other artists, letting my flow simply become a dance between my mind and body. Practice sessions left me feeling light and hungry. My appetite slowly returned, for food and for excitement. I thought less of the struggles around feeding myself, indulging in foods I would otherwise \u201cnot waste money\u201d on. It seems I had accidentally found my spark for life again. My writing progressed in new directions as well. Immediately after my event (and for some time prior) I could not string a set of words together that had any notion of joy or optimism. And yet there I was, seemingly suddenly able to add a glimmer of hope sprinkled throughout my expressions of despair.\u00a0\n\nThese small victories felt like conquering mountains along the path to cast my PTSD back into the fires from which it came. I still struggled heavily with having compassion for myself (even though in some part of me I knew I had to at least have some to have come so far) but I was able to provide it to others in droves again. My compassion for others had returned after being clouded by the pessimism that I would never feel better. Sharing kindness in turn gave me more examples of how I could be kinder to myself. I found a middle ground in self-communication after a practice from the Plum Village teachings seeped into me one day. The idea was to try to stay in balance while acknowledging life's situations. When life is going poorly, remind yourself of the positive times experienced, when life is going well, do not forget the struggles from which we come, and the eventual return back to either state at some point. This sentiment made me feel that perhaps there was still a place for me in this existence after all, even as negative as I had become.\n\nI let that notion of balance drive the next chapter of my growth. I started acknowledging that I was nurturing my suffering and creating a space for me to heal within. As I kept claiming to be making changes for the sake of myself, I noticed more and more areas of my life that were unconducive for improvement. I needed to start making larger, more drastic changes if my goals were to be reachable. Situations and places that before had brought me comfortability were now glaring me in the face as sufferings I had become complacent with. So, I pressed on, giving people in situations the opportunity to change, and when they were unable, I would plan my evacuation route and find ways to cut ties that would be safe for all parties involved. These were incredibly difficult shifts and came with many sufferings of change. Yet overall, the changes made way for greater joys and meaningful steps forward.\n\nNow I was entering one of the more treacherous stages of healing, I had shed ties with many dangerous comforts from my existence and was paving my way into a life I felt I could call my own. Up until this point I had had a great many inspirations for self-preservation, but I noticed the further along I got, the less examples I had of people who had progressed past just ditching the harms in their surrounding circle to feel peace. I began to recognize the potential damage of lingering in this in-between stage too long. I had a front row seat of my concerns playing out before my very eyes, one of my former mentors. They had been pivotal to inspiring me to push to make some tough jumps and cut certain ties. It was discouraging to see them not seem to grow past that same stage from the time they had inspired myself to make the shift to the point that I now felt I would surpass them if I kept going. I hadn't known what the next step could be, as now I lacked examples of success beyond this point, but after observation of the continual \u201cpushing away from harm\u201d stage\u2019s backfire, I knew whatever direction I went needed to hold space for others to exist and heal as well, rather than just prioritize my own.\n\nI became somewhat obsessed with checking myself to be sure I wasn't destroying my valued connections with the wonderful people I still had left in my life, which I came to realize meant letting other people become priorities again now that I had thinned the crop to only those capable of supporting my growth. I had spent so much time focusing inward that I almost forgot there was a whole world still operating around me. Self-healing had been my only focus up until this point, and now it was time to slowly sift into the life I had been setting up for myself. At this juncture the \u201csmall things\u201d had begun to matter again without me even realizing it, I was able to deepen connections with those left in my circle by creating space for them and their emotions as I had done for myself. Now when I spoke of suffering, optimism lurked around every corner.\n\nThis practice of communication has carried me into the stage I currently reside in (for the time being). It feels unnatural to say that life is going well, yet to claim the opposite would be false. One of my biggest struggles that I am working on currently is my own ability to self-sabotage. When things finally begin to feel like they are going right, doubt and suspicion rear their heads. Though rather than fight or silence it like I would have been previously inclined, I try to nurture it for what it is and hear out the fears. This can help determine if they are based in reality, and rather than reacting to the ones that are, I talk through them with myself or others. It does wonders for my fears simply to be heard."

I wish I could be able to sleep, but for the last 4 months I haven't been able to sleep at all. Whenever I finally get to bed, the flashbacks come flooding in, and I feel too stressed and anxious to fall asleep. I'll often roll around for hours and hours, panicking and crying. If I am able to get to sleep (often with the aid of physical exertion or alcohol), I can only sleep in 30 minute-1 hr increments, before I end up having some sort of nightmare pertaining to the abuse which swiftly wakes me. As soon as I wake up, I always begin crying, panicking, and hyperventilating, just as I was prior to getting to bed in the first place. I feel that my relationship with sleep has become incredibly tainted. I now just have intense anxiety whenever I think about sleeping or merely sitting in my bedroom. There was one instance lately where I was up for 40 hours straight due to all of these negative emotions I was having. Less dramatically, each night I can really only get myself to rest 4-5 hours at the maximum, and my attempt at rest is so tumultuous, that I just feel more exhausted than I did before. I hardly feel alive anymore, especially considering I can't have the solace of sleep. I haven't seen good, proper rest in such a long time and I feel hopeless in ever fixing that since i've already tried so much. I had to see my abuser yesterday and every time I get sharp pain in my chest, have a panic attack (or get close to it), and immediately feel hopeless, afraid, trapped, and infinitely on-edge. Seeing her immediately reaccesses all of my trauma in the most disturbing way. I was able to sleep for like an hour before a nightmare about seeing her yesterday woke me up. Besides that, i've been up for over 24 hours. I keep replaying everything she has ever said and done to me, and I continually feel worse and worse. I'm afraid that if I don't get to sleep soon, I may have a mental breakdown and start sobbing, but i'm trying my best to keep it together. I'm going to try and distract myself for a little bit even though it'll likely be unsuccessful.

For comparison I was diagnosed with BPD at the age of 15 in 2000, recieved no help, experienced abuse from the place I was diagnosed, and was not aware of this diagnosis until 2016 when I went back to the hospital that diagnosed me as a kid (which also refused to acknowledge that I had PTSD until 2020, never acknowledged or treated my ADHD diagnosed in 2003, and treated me like a pariah due to the BPD misdiagnosis). Throughout this time I was a person with unrecognized autism trying to make it in a workplace without accommodations, facing profound discrimination leading to repeated terminations, and coming home to copious amounts of abuse and rejection from relationships I stayed in to meet my needs, my dysfunctional family, and the every present demands of just living as a moderate support needs autistic person who internalized the profound ableism, judgement, and emotional abuse of the world around me. Even more so this is on top of several sexual assaults, homelessness due to an inability to maintain employment and secure income, a severe medical injury when I was an infant, almost dying from a surgery as an adult, being robbed, forced displacement from across the world due to COVID, a federal lawsuit due to discrimination, witnessing my mother and sistet almost drown at the age of 10, losing my first love to an overdose, and watching a coworker suffer severe burns from having a seizure and falling face first into a vat of boiling water. Throughout all this I had minimal if any friends, everyone left, and once the denial broke and I entered therapy I faced abuse while there, including being thrown out of a treatment program and forced to move back to the abusive home I tried to leave 3000 miles away from my best friend and the first time I was ever able to develop a safe community. \n\nThroughout all this time I tried to work and live as independently as possible. I went to college and graduate school. I became a social worker and learned that the only people that got the jobs I went to school for were skinny nepo babies or those with rich partners that could support them as they worked for sub market wages. I couldn\u2019t afford to do what I went to school for and when I finally got a job doing what I wanted to do I lost it within 4 months because despite using the job as the push to escape an abusive relationship and move across the country, I found my self in yet another abusive relationship, this time 3x worse than before. And this was a pattern. Find some piece of shit to rescue me and take care of me because I knew that the job would not last and in the process lose the very thing that could allow me the means to escape the abuse. Again I had NO idea I had autism and while I knew I had ADHD I just was told to take stimulants which much of the time I couldn\u2019t afford, suck it up and work my ass off despite going through hell my entire life. \n\nI kept running, finding some stupid ass low paying job where I was subjected to repeated accounts of secondary trauma (and even witnessed trauma myself including watching a child almost starve to death), lost the job, spent several months trying to find another one, only to lose it 6-12 months later over a misunderstanding or some bitch ass, sociopathic supervisor not liking me and treating me like so many of the mean girls and bullies I experienced from the time I was 4. I even once got fired for \u201cpoor judgement\u201d and \u201cunprofessionalism\u201d while I watched my supervisor repeatedly stalk clients on their social media and openly mock them to other coworkers (she also made fun of my disabilities to my face and did not hide her disdain for me). I had yet another supervisor tell me how talented I was as she fired me and I received an award for the work I did (and self financed because the program did not have a budget and I was essentially fired for requesting one and getting upset that I had to use my AMERICORPS salary to finance this) two weeks after the program terminated me and I saw none of the grant money I worked my ass off to get.  \n\nSo for all this on November 12th, 2023 there was a misunderstanding at work. I was frustrated and exhausted because I had no PTO to take time off to see a show because all my PTO was used for \u201cmental health days\u201d and to recover from the multiple illnesses my body acquired from working with children and dealing with a lifetime of chronic stress. I said something that was intended to poise a question, but was said in the wrong context. People freaked the fuck out and due to client confidentiality and fear for the safety of the client I could not say anything to defend myself. I dealt with this only to enter a meeting where a parent (not the parent involved in this situation)sat there for 20 minutes accusing me of lying about what I said, not giving a shit about their kid after spending hours trying to find specialized care for them, and telling me I was a piece of shit. I just lost it then and gave up trying to fight. 15 years of fighting gone. \n\nSo for those of you who have suffered copious amounts of abuse and trauma, how the fuck do you reconcile that because of the shit people have done to you, you will never be afforded the opportunity to break free and will always be stuck dependent on people who may very well be just as abusive as the ones who initially caused the PTSD. \n\nI did every fucking thing people told me to do. College, internships, graduate school at an elite private school, study abroad, unpaid practicum, volunteering, etc and for what? To face the possibility of receiving $1200 a month for the rest of my life if someone who has never met me decides that I am worthy of such a \u201cgenerous\u201d sum of money and if I was sick enough during the time some fucking government agency decided the hell I was subjected to was enough to determine me eligible for SSDI and not SSI and if me going back to work after being told I was crazy by a boss that denied me access to my therapist and 2 weeks after I nearly died from a gallbladder surgery is worth it. \n\nFor those in this situation how the hell do you make sense of the idea that because of the actions of others your safety is again compromised and if it were not for my boyfriend\u2019s generosity (he\u2019s safe and kind thank god) I would be homeless and/or back in the home I\u2019ve been trying to escape since I was 19. Please make this make sense because I spent my life trying to help others after all most did was hurt me over and over and over and over again. \n\nI guess the 25 year old idealistic, naive, and hopeful young adult who looked at my mother, while in deep denial of the situations that had occurred and were currently occurring around her, and told her that I \u201cwant to suffer too\u201d had no idea what she was in for and got a bit of sweet poetic justice people only wish upon their worst enemies.

It was my first time having THC, and I accidentally had 100 mg worth of edibles. To make a long story short, I felt like I was dying, and I was bedridden for days. Since then, I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019m perceiving the world differently. It\u2019s hard to describe, but it feels like something in my head changed. I know everything around me is real, but it\u2019s like my brain is processing it all differently.\n\nI\u2019ve also dealt with anxiety and panic attacks since the overdose, which I would rarely/never have. Additionally, I started experiencing brain fog, but I\u2019ve had my fair share of experiences with that. I\u2019m planning to see a mental health professional, but I\u2019m wondering if it's PTSD, or if anyone here has gone through something similar and can share their recovery journey. How long did it take for things to feel normal again? What steps helped you the most?\n\nAny insights, tips, or honestly just support would mean a lot right now. Thank you in advance!"

She had her eyes on us 24/7 and loved us much. Our Father also loved us much but showed it us indirectly. But things turned tables when we got to like 8-10 years of Age. My Father started influencing us alot by talking about problems and stuff. We always got blamed at relatives for doing things you dont do at this age anymore. My Father always told every secret of our family to them and stuff. It was exhausting. My Mother was also against it and tried always giving him his fault. They always were argued and it started at like 14-15 were it started to hit us mentally. They always did this on purpose. My Brother wasnt hit mentally as hard. He lives like a normal life. But it hit me very hard since i was 14-15. This always arguing wasnt the part that got me mentally killed tho. It was that my mother always watched out after me since toddler and developed and phobic psycho issue were she always had to watch out for me. When i was 10 she tried everything for me to stay at home. Whenever i had school she followed me to school with her bike till the age of 13! I always told her i dont want this but she never did listen. She was already called by relatives a psycho of her phobic behavior. The teenage years of 10-17 she never let me out. She always tried to look after me. Whenever she saw like an car driving near me she screamed in public watch out and stuff. Like an real psycho. Whenever she did this tho i always started to get mentally ill. I always walked away from her in public like i dont know her. She always tried to help others. Even when its meant to laugh at her own children or tell their secrets nobody should know to satisfy others. \n\nNow that i am 17 Years Old things have gotten alot worse. I actually started resisting. Whenever my Father comes home i tell him hey. Sometimes he fells good and when he feels bad he dosent say anything but just tells me to fuck off. I started my Business at 15 because i wanted to do something out of myself. My Father was very proud at first and told all my relatives that i did this and that. But then when things didnt went to good. He didnt stick to me. He started talking bad about this and that that you are destroying the family with this business so his mood was either when things went good and bad. Now that i have gotten Mentally completely ill (skipping work so i dont feel bad, having depression) he starts saying my son doesnt do this and that. He always puts me down everyday. EVERY fucking day he tells me i am this bad and this bad. And this isnt even the bad thing. My family always argues every day literally it got to the point where its impossible to just do my thing. I hardly try to speak to them but hey always involve me in stuff and then tell i do everything wrong my father then says i wish i never born children. Go out of my house. My Mother then argues with him and they almost fight. This is now everyday minimum 2x times a day and it drains my energy i dont eat most times or dont do the things i want i dont leave the house because i have depression. Now the even bigger problem is my mother does prevent me from sleeping. When it gets to like 9-10pm my mother just randomly starts saying now you go to sleep. And i am okay with that. But then she repeats it everyday minimum 10 times. So her Goal is to fuck my head over to sleep. Then when i actually lay in Bed at like 11 pm she screams now go to sleep. And i say yes i will then she comes in my Room again and again and again then she starts screaming and then she goes at living room and starts banging on my wall aware that my father is sleeping. She wants to make me sleep on force rather than find my sleeping schedule. Whenever i ask my friends parents if they do this they never said yes. I have no parent seen do this. \n\nAll in all i know there might be many opinions on this but all i can say for me. This family is not normal. Sleep prevention, Always screaming giving each other faults. Enjoying the process of killing your son mentally. I just dont know what i can do anymore to this. Everybody in this Family is literally bringing hate in family everyday and i just cant stand it without getting physical abusive with them. They never hit me or anything like that but sometimes i just always think about it.\n\nI have found out that i may suffer from one of these things:\nADHS (However, suppressed by depression i am not angry all the time i never am, i am just very active when my depression fades a way for 1 hour or so rather than that i am always down 24/7)\nSocial Anxiety\nInsomnia (probably because of Parents)\nPTSD\nHyperthyroidism\nbehavioral disorder\n\ntelogenes effluvium\n\n\n\nPlease tell me what i can do and feel free to ask any questions."

I guess I just need something positive at the moment. \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve hit a brick wall with my mental health and any insight or advice would be appreciated. Thank you. "

    "content": "Being here in LA for these catastrophic wildfires this past week, seeing these entire neighborhoods ravaged and shattered, and having to evacuate from the fires myself has triggered some kind of trauma I (30y/o) didn't realize I had been holding on to for the past 12 or so years from living in an affected community in New York during Hurricane Sandy. \n\nThe year prior to Sandy, my family had evacuated for another hurricane (Irene in 2011) and ended up getting hit worse where we evacuated to, so we had decided to stay in place for Sandy. The power went out. The floodwater began churning through the streets and rising higher, engulfing our driveway, our lawn, pouring in through the doors. We tried to save as many of our belongings as possible, wading through thigh-deep mucky seawater as it filled our house in total darkness.\n\n  \nIn the days following as the flooding subsided, we ripped damaged furniture, carpeting, walls, appliances, and belongings out of my childhood home with our own hands before rot could set in. A nor'easter followed just days later, dumping nearly a foot of snow and downing power lines across the community. Weeks went by without power restoration. We lived in the wreckage of our house for months, without heat or insulation, without clean water or a way to cook. My parents were among the many to be taken advantage of and scammed and run around by bogus contractors rushing to make money in the wake of the hurricane and though I have since moved, they are *still* struggling with shoddy repairs and fraudulent permits, more than a decade later.\n\n  \nWhile my current partner and our pets and I were in the car last week evacuating from the wildfires, I was fighting to suppress rising memories of this time. It's been a week and my mind is flooded with these thoughts of losing everything. We and our animals are safe, and our dwelling and belongings have been thankfully untouched, but I still find myself inundated with strong and complicated emotions that I am unable to organize in my brain. I've been crying every day. I haven't been able to work. I've been struggling to sleep. \n\n  \n\n\nI don't know where I was going with this, I just needed a place to get it all out onto paper hoping it would help. Not sure what else to do or how to get back to normal. Thanks for listening."

    "title": "Had my first ever experience with group psychodrama today. It was a disaster. Went through my first panic attack in over a decade.",
    "content": "I\u2019ve been in treatment for my eating disorder since July. I\u2019ve really enjoyed the program and this is the longest and best I\u2019ve ever been in recovery. Last week we were introduced to the new psychodrama therapist. I have zero experience with it, and quite frankly roleplaying negative experiences of my life (not even the traumatic ones) in a group setting just does not appeal to me.\n\nThis was our first actual group and from the very beginning I knew I was in for a shitshow. The therapist starts off by saying \u201cI want you to think of a time when you were truamatized\u201d. The first thing I thought of was my sexual assault in the psych ward by another patient while I was in a medication induced psychosis.\n\nNow look, one could argue that I could\u2019ve just chosen a little T trauma instead, but for whatever reason I went with the worst moment of my life. Either way though if you ask me about trauma and that\u2019s where my brain goes, so immediately all of the memories started surfacing again. 5 minutes into the group and I\u2019m already distressed.\n\nShe made us one by one tell her about our traumas and most of the clients voiced their discomfort, but she seemed very dismissive about it. When I told mine, she asked \u201cSo that was traumatizing for you?\u201d Uh\u2026 no shit?\n\nOur next assignment was to close our eyes and envision what we were feeling in that moment, essentially having us relive our traumas. For obvious reasons I did not do this.\n\nAfter that she passed out paper and markers and had us draw our emotions. Fine, whatever.\n\nShe had us get up and talk to the drawings like they were the source of the trauma (i.e. a family member, an abuser, etc.). The first girl that went was no issue.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets worse.\n\nThe next person that went had trauma revolving around a family member. I won\u2019t give details obviously, but as he progressed the therapist started mirroring him and essentially saying what she thought he was feeling internally. \n\nThere was a point where she just yelled something that was clearly very triggering for him and he broke immediately. He started sobbing and yelling the things he would\u2019ve said to this family member and it was incredibly distressing to watch and made a ton of repressed memories of my own familial trauma resurface.\n\nOne of my biggest triggers is yelling, even if it\u2019s not directed at me. The second the yelling started I felt like I became detached from my body, like none of this was actually real. I\u2019ve never felt like that before and it was genuinely terrifying. Obviously I do not blame the client for one second, but for the first time since I started treatment, I got up and left group.\n\nThe second I closed the door to the group room I started sobbing and hyperventilating. I\u2019ll be real, it takes a lot to break me so when the clinical director saw me she immediately knew it was bad. She went and grabbed my individual therapist who basically had to sit there and help me ground myself until I could speak again.\n\nWhen I explained to him what happened during group he told me that essentially I derealized. I have friends who experience it, but this is all new to me.\n\nI\u2019ve been texting back and forth with the other clients and every single one said they felt incredibly uncomfortable with the whole process.\n\nSo yeah, not a fan of psychodrama. :)"

    "content": "Hello! I (23f) have recently been going to therapy as I feel like I have things that i was in denial of that I need to work out. I see my therapist every other Tuesday. Last time I went (about a month ago due to me and family getting COVID) she said that she thinks I have PTSD. I would agree with her. \nI have experienced several forms of trauma. My uncle is an abusive alcoholic who put a gun to my mom\u2019s head. My grandfather was too handsy with me. When my mom married the second time, the guy was really nice until after they married. Then he would beat my mom and I. I had carbon monoxide poisoning (due to our landlord) and was sitting on the back of an ambulance while the doctors checked my brother and I. All the while, I watched my mom, grandmother, aunt, and other firemen go grab ALL of our stuff and moved it out. I\u2019ve been stuck in the middle of a \u2018rapid rising\u2019 river, almost not making it back to my group. I\u2019ve seen my entire town flood. When I was a kid I broke my jaw really bad. \nSince I was a child, I\u2019ve had nightmares. I\u2019d wake up screaming and crying for my mom. For the past year (at least) I\u2019ve been having what I call stress dreams EVERY night. It\u2019s to the point that I\u2019m tired all the time but I don\u2019t want to sleep because I know I\u2019ll stress more and wake up more tired. I did get a little bit of a break the night of my brothers wedding. I had officiated and made another speech. By the end of the day, I crashed hard. No dreams. The next night it went back to normal. \nNow, my dreams aren\u2019t always about the actual events of my trauma. I often have dreams of the world ending and the sky getting red. The darker the red, the closer to the end of the world other dreams, we are in the woods, running from something. Other times, the world is flooding and my mom and I cannot contact anyone. When we try to leave, we get blocked by the police because everything up ahead is already under water. I\u2019ve dreamt that I\u2019m on a boat in the middle of the ocean in the night and it wrecks. I would look under me in the water and a shark was right there, mouth open. I\u2019d have dreams about needing another surgery. I don\u2019t wake up screaming but my dreams leave me very distressed when I do wake up. I am anxious, sad, mad, stressed, and overwhelmed when I wake up and those feelings last all day. Last nights dream was particularly intense. \n\n\u2018My brother and his wife were giving birth. It was a home birth in their bathtub. My mom and I are sitting on the couch in the living room, waiting for the news. My brother and sil come out with one baby. A boy. They say they had twins. I ask where the other one is and brother said \u2018in the bathroom\u2019. I asked if I could go in and see the baby and he said \u2018you can go in\u2019. So I do and I see a pale baby with the umbilical cord still attached, floating face down in the tub. I grab the baby and while pulling it out of the water, I noticed that it is cold and stiff. It\u2019s a girl. I try to do CPR and holler out to call an ambulance then I wake up.\u2019 I cried when I woke up. \nIm exhausted all the time and I just want simple happy dreams or none at all. Im so sorry for the lengthy post I just don\u2019t know what else to do. The I\u2019ve tried so many medications and they haven\u2019t worked. Anyways, no more pity party and back to the question.\nWhen I describe these dreams, I don\u2019t know what to call them. Whether they are bad dreams or nightmares or stress dreams or what have you. Any advice is much appreciated and if anyone has any ideas on how to manage my feelings I will happily ready everything! Thanks in advance and good night! "

    "content": " ok this is like totally tmi and i\u2019ve never shared anything like this before, especially not online, but about two months ago, on the night of my son\u2019s first birthday, i was raped anally by someone very very close to me. since then, i can\u2019t seem to process anything. i have similar trauma from my childhood that i can think through in detail and map out on a mental timeline. but with this particular event, my brain will not let me think about it. every time i try to think about the events leading up to it, during it, or even weeks after it, i feel like my brain just shuts down and i can\u2019t properly remember anything. i\u2019m in a near constant state of dissociation. \n\n i have a one year old son and i\u2019m honestly kind of glad my brain is responding like this because it allows me to behave relatively normally and take care of my child like a regular mother. in my high school years i behaved incredibly recklessly due to past trauma and landed myself in rehabs and mental institutions more times than i\u2019d like to admit. obviously i\u2019m a very different person now and would never act on my impulsive thoughts considering i have a baby in the picture. however, after my son goes to sleep it\u2019s like all hell breaks lose. all of a sudden i feel like i can\u2019t sleep despite being EXHAUSTED the entire day. no matter how hard i try i just can\u2019t get myself to lay down. my brain floods with thoughts of self harm, suicide and other risky behaviors. and i can\u2019t shut it off no matter what i do. i feel so helpless. the whole night i\u2019m trying to keep calm and make it to morning. pacing back and forth or watching tv to distract myself. God forbid the show has a joke about anal though or i literally start tweaking the fuck out lol i know that sounds stupid but i genuinely get panic attacks from jokes like that even if it has nothing to do with rape. which sucks cause we live in a culture where anal is a very normal thing so jokes like that are in basically everything. i usually only can get myself to go to sleep at around 5 am after my fianc\u00e9 comes home (he works night shift) which is absolutely not sustainable as my son has a normal sleep schedule (asleep by 9 pm). and when i do finally get to sleep, it\u2019s just brutal gruesome nightmares. i never ever feel rested. most days i find myself sleeping in past noon, usually around 2 or 3, while my fianc\u00e9 takes care of our son. i feel so guilty. this is killing me and it\u2019s absolutely not sustainable. \n\n when i do wake up, i genuinely feel like a zombie. no amount of sleep ever feels like enough. \n\n taking care of my son comes naturally to me so that\u2019s not an issue. i usually just play with him all day and we go for walks and to the park and everything is fine. i smile and play and talk to him and it reminds me of a time where i felt happier and wasn\u2019t just faking my way through life. the whole time i\u2019m barely hanging on. but like i don\u2019t even feel sad. i just feel empty and out of it. so exhausted and just completely beat down. nothing feels okay anymore. i\u2019m totally dissociated during the day and completely hyper vigilant at night. it\u2019s literally driving me crazy. \n\n i seriously don\u2019t know how to fix this. i can\u2019t take medication to sleep cause i need to not be knocked out if my baby starts crying in the middle of the night and needs me (which he frequently does). obviously can\u2019t smoke weed or anything. i have no one to talk to either. the only two people who know are my fianc\u00e9 (who kind of acts weird about it and is also very close to the man who assaulted me so it\u2019s kind of an odd situation where he doesn\u2019t want to fully admit something bad happened) and my ex best friend. when i told her she said that i absolutely have to go to the police and when i refused, she ended the friendship and called me a bitch lmao. i\u2019m catholic and the only thing that\u2019s sort of helps and brings me some sort of peace is going to church. but it\u2019s not a cure or anything. i still live with my parents (i\u2019m only 19) and they have no idea. it\u2019s so disturbing watching everyone act like everything\u2019s normal while simultaneously harboring this dark secret that could blow up my whole life and the lives of so many other people, while also being the victim of it all. i almost feel angry at the whole world for not realizing something is wrong. but also i would never ever want anyone to find out. anyways i\u2019m considering going back to therapy but i lowkey don\u2019t have a drivers license and my fianc\u00e9 takes the car to work everyday so not sure what to do. if u have any advice PLEASE  share. i\u2019m so desperate and willing to listen"

Yesterday was my 7th session. \n\nAll it's done is brought up stuff about the abuse I endured and the trauma rather than help me. I actually feel way worse now than I have. \nI'm so anxious that I'm worrying about everything right now, I haven't been able to sleep so I've currently been awake for 24 hours. I've even started worrying that I've caught an std from an encounter I had almost a month ago. (Rationally I know how random this is, it's my brain latching to something to push my anxiety into) \n\nBUT it doesn't make it any better. It's like my brain now is always switched on, and I'm in a bubble.

So, I want to know; is trauma only developed from a biologically distressing event, like blood, gore, death, violence, etc?

I remember multiple dreams from one night too.\nThen id wake up panicked, heart racing and my overall day would be affected with me being irritable, stressed, panicked.\n\nI was recently thinking for about, indirect symptoms.\n\nSpecifically, discomfort in my torso, not like pain, it's a weird feeling, I'm unsure what it is. It will get worse, il gag a lot and then il feel an but better.\nAnd i when I close my eyes, I see vivid images with lots of emotion.\nJust the other day, I was parked up near the beach, enjoying the night view of the sea front.\nFeeling good. I closed my eyes, and saw a weird thing, with a pulsing and bulging lump, I was curious and felt compelled. I watched as it continued to pulsate and bulge from this sphere of maybe sinew?\nI was then unable to open my eyes, I felt like I couldn't even try. Like a trance?\nI felt overshadowed with emotion, and this fleshy sphere morphed it's shape over and over until I opened my eyes and cried.\n\nIf anyone can talk to me about those other symptoms, because I'm so alone and want answers.\n\nPs. I am not usually emotional at all, I'm diagnosed with autism and alexithymia. I go years without crying, or even feeling like I need to cry.\n\nThanks"

Because of the trust issues stemming from my PTSD, I'm quite delayed when it comes to romantic relationships. Last month, however, I met a girl and we've really hit it off. We've been on multiple dates, text constantly, and she's even spent a few nights at my apartment.\n\nI like this girl a lot. She is so kind, patient, and understanding, and talking and spending time with her is really fun. I feel like I have so much more energy after spending time with her, and like I can feel my life getting better in real time. Not to mention, she's really cute. I should be euphoric, right?\n\nInstead, I'm constantly worrying. Can I trust this person? Will she try to control me? If I don't do what she wants, will she hurt me? Despite the fact that she hasn't shown the slightest bit of violence or controlling behavior towards me, these are the thoughts that plague me whenever we're apart and sometimes even when we're together. I can be enjoying an evening with her, having a good time, and then suddenly, I'll feel trapped and overwhelmed and like I just want her to leave. Fortunately, she's very understanding. Though I haven't given her the gory details of my trauma, she knows I have PTSD and I've given her a basic overview of how it affects my relationships (namely, how it makes me freak out and think people who want to get close to me are bound to hurt/kill me). She's said that if I ever need it, we can just drop everything and do separate things for a few hours or even that she can just go for a walk so I have some private space to calm myself down.\n\nI'm just really frustrated at how these feelings make me feel like shit even when she's so wonderful, and especially how they seem to dull the positive emotions I should have. I'd like to ask how you all coped with the difficulties presented by PTSD in your romantic relationships. Did you just push through them until you'd finally developed trust with the other person? Were there strategies you used to quiet the negative, fearful voices that constantly intruded on the relationship? I'd also love if you all could share any resources that were helpful to you, like books, worksheets, videos, etc.  \n\nThank you!\n\n(BTW, I have also recently started seeing a therapist again, in case that's relevant)"

I didn't go into details because all of this has just been a lot and I'm not sure if anyone here will understand. Going to go out on a limb and see if anyone happens to have any specific advice for my situation. \n\n\n\n\nTW: Violence and S/A mentions, minority stressors\n\n\n\nMy spouse was threatened at work with corrective rape and assault because she is married to me, a transgender man. On top of very recent surgery for her that triggered memories of my mother's unfortunate medical ailments and times during my childhood, followed by people at work seeing me in distress during that time they started acting in such a way to me because of my minority status (they told me straight up). Add that my workplace has told me to be patient, my union has told me to be patient, and one supervisor straight up laughed at me over it all, I am struggling. \n\nHas anything happened TO ME? Nope, not a damn thing lately. But here I am, out of work for now because going there sends me into a spiral. Staying home feels safe, but every day my spouse goes into work I am met with going into a spiral again just a lot less. Insurance sees it as a work issue, not covered by them. WCB sees my medical file and sees I'm trans, says that there is no way to prove my stress is only work related, no coverage from them. Police see it all as an interpersonal conflict, no help from them. Union sees it as \"we have to listen to all sides\" issue, no help from them. Employer keeps asking if I just want to quit already (they sent me paperwork to give for unemployment filings encouraging me to given my notice), no help from them. Gone through a number of therapists, some stating beyond scope, others trying but so limited on what can be done about the situation, no help from them. Friends of ours just don't know how to help, typically just start weeping, or have been so burnt out by it all so no help from them. Spouse is a mess some days, but dissociates easily. Field we are in is best paying, best benefits, without it our life saving medications are not available. Law firms (many contacted) are limited because of the nature of law needed AND most have a conflict of interest with the union or employer having represented one or the other, and in my case it would be me going against both. \n\nI am at a loss for what to do with myself in terms of employment, in terms of mental health care during this time. I'm in resilience training and I can say that other's in similar situations as me are struggling to find worth from the whole thing because what can we realistically get out of it? I am at such a loss of what to do. I'm doing exposure therapy to actively try to go back to something hostile but with mounting hatred for folks of my minority status in the western world, this hostility is growing. I am hurting and struggling with threats when folks find out and when I am in public spaces with visibly queer people. I can hide myself well enough but I get \"transvestigated\" because of scar tissue I happen to have. I can function daily well enough that I don't warrant disability, but when I go into workplaces that find out (and do to legal things with background checks it's not hard to figure out) I am met with hostility. What the hell do I do? What therapy can help me through this? Shitty life syndrome makes CBT feel like a stupid gaslighting chore of accepting that life sucks and suck it up buttercup, enjoy your harassment. I know that is not what it is but when the therapist says, there is nothing I can do to help you, I don't think anyone can. What do you fucking do? I feel failed by life because of populist politics using me as a scape goat. \n\nI breathe, I exercise, I eat well, I do physio, I do somatic exercises, I do journalling, I do therapy, I spend time with friends, I engage in hobbies, I limit screen time, I wash myself up and take care of myself. I don't drink and I don't do recreational drugs. I still feel dread, panic, and then have flashes of images of people harming my loved ones because I'M trans. I promptly dissociate and I dissociate a lot. What more can I do? I took medications but the side effects after six months were great and I stopped showering and no longer enjoyed my hobbies at all. I have tried others with no luck, and I don't want medication anymore when things are so situational based. \n\nThis isn't hopeless and I find joy in little things involving my spouse, involving friends, in the joys in life. There is so much joy in life. Employment brings me no joy and it is painful, I've already lost 3 jobs because of my trans status. \n\nI have attempted radical acceptance of this situation I cannot control but I am left feeling a level of rancor which impacts my ability to enjoy life. I don't want to accept that people like myself have to accept harassment and persecution. I have been active in social movements and it gives me some purpose but I find that they are being met with so much hatred that I don't know how many more violent assaults I can endure witnessing. What the hell do I even do? \n\nDoes anyone know resources for those trapped in violent areas, or just like... Resources that can actually ease this? I hate this and it feels like the more happy I am, the more bitter certain individuals become towards me. Even with cisgender (the opposite of transgender, just a non-transgender person) folks I know have told me how it isn't fair that I can access therapy and they can't. Or it isn't fair I'm married and found someone and they can't as a non-trans person. It isn't fair that I can still laugh and smile when I play with my pets, etc. and how lucky I am I'm not working right now and \"milking it.\" It isn't fair that I have stable housing and they don't. This is such a joke to me and I find it weird that folks like this exist that would say these things. \n\nA ramble to say the least, but I just hope there are resources out there online that is available internationally to people (I am not based in the US).

I have trouble devesting emotionally from tragedies in the world because it makes me feel like my experiences are just the tip of such a sad and horrific iceberg.  I feel so much anger that there can be so many people living with trauma and still the tides haven't turned, and people and societies continue making the same mistakes.  I feel like there is a strong and legitimate sadness in the world that has become an excuse to drink more than I should (I also write letters to governments but I imagine they must laugh at my words, so it is just one more negative coping strategy).  Sometimes I think it all hits me more intensely than others around me because of my history, or maybe I am still in overdrive and the stress exceeds my coping capacity.  \n  \nI realize at this age how long I have been coasting on feelings that I made it, I survived.   \nIt doesn't matter.

    "content": "Hello,\n\nIt's my first post here (M20). I don't know what drove to write this. I guess it was the fact that I feel no one understands. Ever. \n\nI was recently diagnosed with ptsd following a series of events that happened in the last years. I never thought it could lead to ptsd, because I was so used to the pain I was in all the time. I'll try to keep it short (tw: self-harm, suicide)\n\n1. When I was 14 I started to harm myself.  My dad was emotionally abusing my mom, but we were forced to show off a fake smile everyday. He was never abusive to me though (this is important for the bigger picture). So I started to cope by hurting myself. This went on for 4 years during which no one figured out. I only stopped once I realised in therapy how unhealthy that is for me.\n\n2. My sister tried to end her life at 13, three years ago. It was out of the blue. I had my first severe panic attack that day and things were never the same. I was left with flashbacks, recurrent panic attack, I started abusing alcohol and cigarettes. I was also recurrently losing contact with reality for brief periods of time. The pain of the memory was too great. \n\n3. Last month my gf passed out in college. She has multiple health issues, two of which are pretty serious (an autoimmune disorder and recurrent bouts of urticatia, the reason she passed out and ended up in the ER). You see, this seems pretty little, but it triggered something inside me. I can't say why, but it made me go back to my panic attack, anxiety, I am in constant stress that something will happen again, I get flashbacks and intrusive thoughs, I am very distrustful of people. It's like I'm waiting for something to happen again. \n\nConsidering this, my therapist recognised ptsd. I was surprised because none of the above happened TO ME. But something did happen to me, because I'm not the same and I haven't been in a while. I have most of the textbook symptoms, except I only learnt recently they are ptsd symptoms. Now I don't know what to do with this information\n\nEdit: I hope I didn't violate any of the rules of the community"

    "content": " (TW: S-side, Dr*GS, Domestic V.)\n\nBefore stating this, I want to say I go to therapy and I try to stay on top of triggers and noticing when I'm going to start shutting down. By the end of this it will make sense why I'm here.\n\nSo, my first memory was at the age of 3 or 4 (parents can't verify what age) and it's a heavy one. During an argument between my parents, my dad pushed my mom. Since he had sworn to never do that (and he suffered from untreated illness and loved drugs) his first response was to grab a steak knife, drive it into his wrist, and pull up. I vividly remember the skin separating as the blood spurted on our off-white colored fridge. My brother was less than a year old at the time, so I grabbed the baby carrier he was in and went running for help at my grandparents who lived just down the hill. From there on is mostly a blur. I remember sitting at the hospital with my mom and brother, both of them crying uncontrollably as little me tried to comfort them. He survived that attempt, luckily. But it was far from over.\n\nOver the next 20 years of my life I saw him die, attempt, or come close to attempting 8 other times. 4 of those were the same method as before, the one that stuck with me the most being when he paced around outside of my grandparents' house for some time before using his pocket knife while leaning up against my grandma's bus. Another that always comes up is when he took a family member's pistol and put it in his mouth with full intent. My sister was just a toddler then and I made sure her and my brother were inside without much of a clue that Dad was about to do something irreversible. My grandfather managed to get the gun away from him just in time. He was in martial arts, so disarming someone came naturally. But that's not the end to it all either.\n\nOn three different occasions I witnessed him overdose and begin to cross over. The first was when I was 5. After an argument with my mom he decided to smoke something off of foil (I was born in 96, so this was before fentanyl, he was doing heroin) afterwards he slumped down in the couch as his eyes rolled back, nothing I wasn't already used to. But this time he stopped breathing altogether, and began to turn blue. I was oddly calm about the situation, telling my mom \"dad'll be okay\" or something along those lines. I thought he was just really high. But that image is burned into my head. Like I said, there's many more of these memories that I won't discuss here, as these are the biggest ones.\n\nFast forward to 2023. After seeing him relapse 8 years prior, I knew the day would come. One day after work I had the urge to get taco bell. He forced my mom and siblings out of the house so he was all alone, with me checking in him nearly every day, staying as long as I could stomach the company he kept. This day I didn't see any cars there. For a split second I debated whether to check on him or go get us Tacos and check on the way back. When I went to the door, I heard light movement, but got no answer at the door. My instincts from childhood kicked in, so I kicked in the door to find my father turning a shade of blue and growing cold fast. I immediately called the emergency services and frantically paced back and forth, waiting for help to arrive (if I knew CPR I would have tried, but I didn't want to make things worse). Medics and police arrived, tried narcan, and when it didn't work, rushed him to the hospital. It set me back what felt like years on my healing journey, and threw my whole life off. He survived but he hasn't been the same since. It still hurts my heart, but I don't speak on it much.\n\nSince then the nightmares are more frequent again, with the most recent being today. After finally falling asleep I had a crazy dream where close to the end, that pistol attempt was successful. The image was so vivid I don't know if I can go back to sleep. I guess all I'm really writing here for is some support and advice. Like what do you do when it becomes impossible to sleep without seeing things? I usually take trazadone to sleep when this happens, but lately it results in my brain doubling down on said nightmares. How do you navigate these kinds of things? For the most part I feel I've reached a point of high functionality but these nightmares put me in a headspace that physically feels weird."

(I was originally told i \u201ccant have ptsd because i wasnt in a war\u201d, that was years ago though). \n\nIt all got bad about four weeks ago when my dissociation turned into raging panic attacks, which then developed into full on flashbacks. Times where I genuinely thought I was back to being me at 12 years old stressing about my \u201cclients\u201d and stuff. My boyfriend and parents and friends tried to help me how they could but things just kept spiraling until i couldnt leave the house or sleep at night. That was when I got the diagnosis, a week ago. \n\nI guess im posting because two days ago, coincidentally my 18th birthday, a former \u201cclient\u201d found my social media. I dont know how. I look completely different (because duh i grew up), I use a different name, and I completely cut off all connections with people from my past.

(My boyfriend already knows everything, so idk what he was thinking would happen). He then messaged my boyfriend privately trying to expose me for being a former sex worker. Telling my boyfriend a lot of graphic and really cruel things. My boyfriend tried to get the guys name, but he wasnt successful and after a couple minutes I just begged him to block the guy. Which he did. \n\nI just dont really know what to do right now. Im terrified. Nobody from my past has reached out in years, especially not a former \u201cclient\u201d. I feel so scared to leave the house, or to even open my curtains. I already havent been to school in months because of my newfound mental health issues and now this is happening and Im just a loss. Im terrified. I need advice from anyone just how can I function again how can I even look in a mirror because right now all I do is lay in bed.

And I think and 14 it started because when I was 8 one of my first abusers was 14. \n\nAnd ever since then I\u2019ve been having intrusive thoughts and nightmares of hurting people especially kids. I would never do that it\u2019s like the biggest thing id never want to do. I\u2019m very protective of children. I\u2019m the kind of person if I saw someone hurting a child in the streets id save the child. And I always look after my younger family members.\n\nRecently I\u2019ve still been having intrusive thoughts but not so much about that. Until yesterday my 12 M year old cousin and I often play games together. So he called me asking me to play among us with him. About 10 minutes through playing he told me that his friend is messaging him and wants to play too. (The friend is either 11 or 12M idk how old). My cousin then added him to the call too. And we were playing among us the 3 of us.\n\nThen the friends little sister came into his room asking what he was playing and he said \u201cI\u2019m playing among us with (Cousins Name) and his cousin (My Name)\u201d and the sister started talking to me saying hi and stuff. Then their mother went into the room telling the little sister to go to bed now. She said \u201cbye (cousins name) bye (my name)\u201d. And that was that.\n\nAfter like 5 minutes his mother comes back into the room asking who I am and he says I\u2019m his cousin and he joined our game. She started telling him off. Not because I\u2019m a stranger or I\u2019m 17 but because I\u2019m a girl. And she was saying \u201cyou know I\u2019m not comfortable with you having a girlfriend\u201d Like? EW? And he was like \u201cwhat? It\u2019s his cousin?\u201d And she was like \u201cis she your girlfriend\u201d and he was like \u201cwhat are you talking about she\u2019s older than us\u201d and then the mother was like \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not your girlfriend. All you had to say was it\u2019s not your girlfriend.\u201d And he was like \u201cit\u2019s not my girlfriend\u201d and my cousin was like \u201cit\u2019s not his girlfriend it\u2019s my cousin we were playing first then (friends name) joined\u201d Then the friend left the call. \n\nMe and my cousin kept playing then the friend joined back 5 minutes later and literally 5 minutes later the mother is back and she\u2019s like \u201cI\u2019m staying in the room until that GIRL has left. I don\u2019t want you dating people. Why can\u2019t you play with boys?\u201d I then left the call and the game.\n\nI feel awful. And I\u2019m now spiralling that I\u2019m a creep. I have been in bed all day depressed. Not because of the stupid game but because I\u2019m like \u201coh my god I\u2019m actually a creep like them I\u2019m going to become a rapist like them or something\u201d.\n\nEven though the conversation was innocent.

Men look at me all the time and I am unfazed and don't care.  \n\nEventhough I am very beautiful I know that it's a doubled edged curse.  It's been weaponized against me by sick, crazy men throughout my life.  I though going for a normal appearing awkward guy was safe.  My husband played the \"pick me, I'm safe\" role.  He played it so well that I did not realize that he was a total empathy empty person until after I was pregnant when our cat died.  I think I am actually a victim of marriage fraud and reproductive coercion.  Impregnated almost immediately, even directly following a miscarriage without healing first.  He was finally arrested for misdemeanor assault during an exchange of our son.  He harasses me still filming me at every exchange.  He is legitimately insane, and I believe a danger to our child.\n\nI'm not sure if I will get advice.  But after all the years of abuse in my life, sexually I am now repulsed by men.  Not that I've become gay, but I see men as these violent conquerors that have the ability to destroy me, and since I don't want that in my life, I'm content with being alone.  Why would I ever live with someone or be legally entrapped in another abuser's sick web of lies?  It's not as if an abuser is like, \"Hey ladies, I mistreat women, because I can and I do it and enjoy it.\"  They do not show you who they really are until you are caught and they think they can keep you no matter how badly they treat you or how many enablers justify their behavior, even at the expense of a child.

This post is about my grandpa. \n\nMy memories go as far back as being 4-5 with these, as a child ( and this continued to when i was probably around 16) he would pull me in as tight as he could and kiss me of the lips, like almost make out territory - stick his tongue in my mouth. Additionally i remember he used to consistently as me to sit on his lip, where he\u2019d caress the inside of my thighs and upper leg. i have this one particular remember (and i know it happened more then once)  where he once again got me to sit on his lap, and he kept bouncing me on his leg, and then got really handsy, keep in mind i was in primary school, i remember because i hadn\u2019t started wearing bras again, and it was at that weird pre-teen phase (around 11-12) and he put his hands under my shirt and up, all over my chest.\n\nI still till this day don\u2019t know if this was \u201cnormal\u201d grandpa behaviour, because i never told anyone until i was 16 and had a breakdown that ended me in hospital, where my mum told me it was a \u201cgenerational\u201d thing and that elderly men just do that. It was never like that for my older sister or brother. Just me. I have never talked to any therapist because it felt like snitching and even till this day i feel like i may be overreacting. The worst part is however, is they had their own key cut for the house (i still live with my parents), every time he\u2019s over i feel wildly uncomfortable and just hide out in my room. do you think this is a normal experience ?

At this point in my life i hadn't had sex fully because one time i tried it failed to penatrate due to vaginismus which i now know was from SA/Rape as a child that i didn't know at the time. So for all intents and purposes i was still a virgin to my knowledge. \n\n>!Now, i get into the ultrasound room to see a male doctor, there was a female nursing student in the room aswell to chaperone. I had no issues with this until he started to do the test and put the probe in, i stop him and explain how painful it is but he just huffs and explains that if i want answers then we need to do this test. (There was no answers btw). He attempts to force the probe in saying i just need to relax but still the same severe pain and i try to breathe through tears and he doesn't stop the test. I couldn't say anything at this point and i feel sick and in tears. But its feels stupid because he said the test was needed and is huffy about needing time to relax before pushing further. I walk out with the student. I was shocked/crying and not really knowing what the hell just happened.!<\n\nLike i know now why it was so hard with my muscle issue but why continue with a test thats obviously hurting someone. Its not like my pain tolerance is low as i get chronic pain anyway so my baseline is different.\n\nI don't think the nursing student was far enough in her career/too timid to know what to say. \n\nA few years later i explained to a nurse what happened and she said he never should have done that test if i was still a virgin..... i was like so what the actual hell was the need to do that. I felt sick again over the whole thing and now when i have similar tests i can see this in my head. \n\nThen i feel stupid because it was a 'necessary' medical test and it can't be assault right?\n\nSo i'm honestly not sure what to do as its been so so long and i'm not sure it was assault. I'm going to try and discuss this to my therapist when i next see her. \n\nI could likely get the name of the person who did the test if needed but i just don't know, am i being too sensative despite normally having a high pain tolerance.

It affects my daily life so much that I'm often isolating myself in a dark room, because it is the only time I feel safe. I'm safest when there are no people around me.\n\nI get the anxiety attacks, the panic attacks, the restless nights and appetite changes. I use substances. I don't take care of myself and don't eat enough. I have lost a lot of weight. The worst part is trying to socialize or being in a public place, such as my work, because I'm so overly cautious, quiet, and clumsy. There's a man whose face I can't look at, not even for a second, because his face looks so much like the person that gave me this trauma... \n\nAnyway, I have this really bad habit of pretending to be perfectly fine. I try to smile at people, although not so much now, since they don't like me anymore. These are people I see five days a week. They talk badly about me. I don't handle rejection well, so I break down and cry in a dark room or I keep doing my job, but I mentally space out and just go through the motions. It's a cleaning job, so I keep cleaning but get lost in my head. I have stopped looking at these people and talking to them, but they now talk about me more. I pretend not to hear it.\n\nUnfortunately it's a very social job, and that's the thing I cannot do. I panic when I have to talk to somebody. They could ask, \"Hey, how are you?\" My response is *always* \"Good, how are you?\" It's automatic and it feels robotic, like I'm not human or something. \n\nI've done this for so long. It's how I survive the day, by simply smiling and saying I'm good. I don't know how to stop.\n\nMaybe it doesn't help that this workplace isn't healthy for me. I had just started this job, not even three months in, when a trauma happened. It involved a coworker, and people talk about it but they don't know *anything.* They treat it as some little mishap, maybe a bit of an inappropriate interaction. It's no big deal to them and it happened \"so long ago.\" Hearing stuff like that pisses me off, because it wasn't some minor thing. A coworker took advantage of me, fully. \n\nIt's so hard to just say the words. I've gone back to avoiding my problems, whisking them into my mind while I force a smile. The place I work in now is the same as when I was traumatized. So I already know, I can't heal in this environment. Worse than that, nobody knows what happened to me so nobody understands my trauma responses. They think I'm weird, or stupid, or they avoid me. I was hurt and I have FOUGHT to be where I am now, only to hear daily smack talk about me, and not a single person there understands. One guy even wears a SI prevention jacket and still doesn't get it... he talks the most crap. \n\nI'm so tired of fighting. Every day is a fight. I'm not eating, sleeping, and I always want to SH. I'm making myself ill. And nobody checks on me either, because I have mastered how to pretend I'm fine. They don't know that I still have flashbacks. I still panic. I fear it happening again, all of the time. Like someone is going to pretend to be a friend just to take advantage, like he did. I trust nobody. How much longer can I do this?\n\nOh, and I'm in therapy, but I don't fully talk to my therapist about this. I'm too ashamed, so I pretend to be better, when I'm actually so much worse. I'm just tougher now. I don't let it show when I'm hurting, and I put on a smile. Even when I see him, hear him, feel him. Nobody knows, nor would they care. It's been three long years.\n\nI know there's a simple answer here, to quit my job and never see those people again. I already did once. I quit for six months and was unemployed for that time. Then I came back. I thought I was ready to go back, but I wasn't fully healed and I have screwed everything up. At this point I've considered outright telling people, but that is a terrible idea. People can't know. I just wish they understood I am struggling, and yet I continue to pretend to be fine. Even though they know I'm not. They think I'm hung up on a guy or something. \n\nI'm sorry for the rant."

I was bending my back to him and holding my legs ( i think)\n\n---( but not like that) but I just didn't know how to say no in a nice way)\nBut that's how I said it. \n\n( And this is why I felt like I confused him)--Because how I did my back to him when I said no.\nAfter I said \u201cNo\u201d ( in a low Tone) he said that he was \u201cgonna put it in.\u201d and I felt him trying to put it in from Behind me. But it didn't go in. ( because when i felt him trying to put it in me.) I was scared and started to yell \u201cyour hurting me\u2013-(twice)--And I don't know why I did this but I got up and sat back down\u2014(but i think i was just confused. Then he started to touch my chest and I tried to move his hands away from my chest. But then he put His hand right back on them. And it was a point  where I was struggling with him and (I tripped alittle ) and when he so me tripped\u2014he tried to force me down on the bench and he did. (BUT I THINK HE HEARD SOMEONE IN THE AREA.) Because  he let me go and grabbed my bag that had my personal stuff in it. Like my: Birth certificate, Ssn, and medical Card in the bag. So I followed him to get my stuff. And he went in a darker area. And when I caught up with him I saw him sitting down on the bench. (The darker area bench.) And i was in a standing  scared position. And he basically said \u201cwhy u acting like that.\u201d---(basically  making me feel like I was overthinking the whole situation. ) so I tried to play it off and at like I was not scared. So I sat next to him and he started to touch my chest again but this time he was holding onto me tight. And we was struggling so much that we fell off the bench. ( and when I  was on the ground  I  asked him can \u201che not hurt me\u201d and he told me that he wouldn't\u2026but when I tried to get on the bench\u2013(basically using the bench to get up\u2026.(I laid on the bench  and  started to move away/ or moved back\u2026.) He pull my pants off and kissed me and started to do it to me.\n\nIm just drowning,  Emotionally. And I'm having a really hard time moving on. \n"

    "content": "this is a pretty long and rambly post about feeling guilt, shame, and embarrassment about my PTSD.\n\nso every night before bed I do my \"PTSD check\" which is what I've begun to call (in my head) the thing I do where I going around the house making sure the doors are locked.\n\nwell tonight my mom woke up for the morning as I was about to go to bed and she caught me checking the front door (the last one I check before bed as it's the closest one to my bedroom). it was dark as I had already turned the lights off so I couldn't see her, but I heard her quietly call my name as to not wake anyone up. it scared the shit out of me. I haven't felt that scared for my life in a while; like genuine \"oh fuck!\" fear. I turned around and just stared across the room but it was too dark to see her. she called my name again and I said \"hello?\" while trying not to panic more than I already was. I could barely make out her body coming through the darkness. it wasn't till I could see her face that the fear fully eased. turns out she just wanted a hug before I went to bed. \n\nI felt a pretty intense need to explain what I was doing but I was overcome with shame and embarrassment. no one knows I do that every night. it's been my little secret. my shameful act of patheticness that I do every single night despite the fact that I know logically I am safe and don't need to worry so much anymore. it's my delusional anxious bullshit. my guilt to carry. yet she saw me do it. \n\nor at least I think she did. it might have been too dark for how to make out what I was doing. luckily she didn't see me stare out of the window for a few seconds \"just to make sure\" like I did just before I made sure the door was locked, which is when she called my name. but I didn't realize till writing this post that she might have just thought I was locking the door before bed, which is at least a somewhat normal behavior I think. oh well.\n\nI hate how much shame, guilt, and embarrassment I feel about my PTSD. I feel like no one believes me; like I'm just making it up or massively exaggerating. when I do tell someone I have PTSD I almost always mention that it's diagnosed so they won't think I'm being dramatic; despite the fact that I firmly believe that self diagnosis is valid. maybe it's just not valid for me? maybe it'd only be \"being dramatic\" if it were me? why do I have so much guilt and self hatred because *I was abused?* what sense does that even make? how did I get here..?\n\n.\n\n***edit/update (kind of):***\nI want to thank everyone for sending me so many nice messages and helping me see this from an outsiders perspective.\n\nI'm sorry I'm taking so long to reply to everyone! this is a very hard subject for me to talk about so I've only been able to reply to a couple comments every few days. I promise I will get to yours tho, I'll read them all, don't worry! all the ones I have read and replied to have been very helpful and supportive and I'm sure the rest are too. thank you again and I'm sorry again for taking so long."

    "content": "TW: mentions of various abuse, self-harm/suicide attempts.\n\nLong story...very long story, and probably not one I'll bother boring anyone with, but basically, the past few years have been hard, mentally and emotionally speaking. Now, it's to the point where it's affecting my health. Sleep paralysis, blood coming from my nose, migraines, nausea...you name it.  \nAnyway, for about 2 yrs now I've been pouring my heart and soul into a novel with the intent of helping myself and others heal from trauma and PTSD, or at least to know they're/we're not alone. It's been liberating at points, yes, but also ridiculously suffocating and...just...too real. It's sci-fi, and I love the genre, but it's just too damn real. My emotions are already a jumbled mess, so this project is kind of added stress even though I know I'd be failing to quit it altogether. I just need to push through harder, ig, but it's FRUSTRATING when I feel so alone with it.  \nLike, I have some people who cheer me on from the surface, but there's still a huge disconnect, or so it feels. Then there are others who've ghosted me about it. Still, more who have gaslit me about it. Been judged bc of how controversial and NOT like a lot of present media is regarding certain topics. It's still the first freaking draft! ON BOOK ONE! JUST BOOK ONE! I'm stuck and fuming at this point, even though I technically know what's next.\n\nWhat are the topics?  \nWell....  \nTwo of my three MCs were abused as kids and teenagers--emotionally/mentally, physically, and sexually. Yup. And I went through similar things myself, which owes to a lot of my PTSD.  \nMMC puts up walls and an aggressive front as a coping mechanism (largely what I do), and sometimes gets into self-harm and suicide attempts (I did years ago...) bc of all of the shit he's been through. FMC (friend and eventual gf) understands him and tries to prevent his...attempts in a way that's, well, empathetic and non-judging. Meanwhile, she's dealing with her own shit bc her primary abuser is back in town and working for the villain. She opens up to MMC about what happened to her, and it pisses him off badly for her sake.  \nYeah, and the MMC also grew up surrounded by a cannibalistic, satanistic (not in name, per se, but lots of similar practices) cult that treated love like a taboo and all sorts of twisted bullshit. Hard stuff.  \nAnyway, this makes the project...close to home, and...controversial.\n\nDuring some research, out of curiosity I looked at how various books on the market dealt with stuff like SA. At \"best,\" (not really good, tbh) it was glossed over or flat out ignored. At worst, it was ROMANTICIZED. Like, 9 times out of 10. I found out about Haunting Adeline. Straight up disgusting frickery from hell. Like, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT STORY? WHO COULD WRITE SUCH EXPLOITATIVE AND FILTHY GARBAGE THAT IS A DIRECT AFFRONT TO ANY SA SURVIVOR? Object rape with a gun. Are you kidding me? Full-on rape for literal dozens and dozens of pages straight. Shit like this \\*supposed\\* \"good and hot guy\" saying, \"your body reacted. You want this.\" Straight from the fucking rapist's handbook of lies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  \nAnd, as if that wasn't bad enough, a side character, also supposedly good and the MC's best friend, CONDONED OBVIOUS RAPE! WTF? THEN...THEN...SOMEHOW, the MC FALLS IN \"LOVE\" WITH THE DIPSHIT? Okay, I know there are twisted accounts of people feeling confused and having feelings, but seriously? Not like that, folks. And it SURE as hell isn't love. Love does not damage someone else's boundaries or take advantage of them.  \nAnyway, after seeing such things, you might say it bolstered my drive for writing my own story. To do JUSTICE to things, or at the very least to the best of my capabilities.\n\nNow, I'm a survivor, yes, but have had zero relationship experience in the sense of trying to navigate...things in light of it to a healing/feeling safe(ish) point. So, in order to do it right for my characters who are, I reach out in effort to get opinions from survivors who've had relationships after such abuse. Many have been quite supportive, BUT...  \nI still feel alone, honestly, bc...well, I go to a different subreddit to get advice for this and I got downvoted to pieces. Like, what gives?????? I pour my LITERAL blood, sweat, and tears into this book and that's the reaction I get? Why??? I'm trying to help my own tribe here, in whatever small way. I'm pretty sure I explained things in a very sensitive and respectful way too, with the exception of slamming that damn Adeline book in order to show that I'm writing DIFFERENT from it. I mean, I get it, I knew my WIP would be super niche from the start--that's okay. What's NOT okay is feeling constantly judged, ignored, or outright battered for it when I'm already struggling enough as is just to get it onto the freaking page.  \n\"Your main character is a temper tantrum throwing maniac and a spineless wimp.\" Dude, he's been through hell and back. He has his issues, yes, but that's seriously a slight to PTSD as a whole, and he's more resilient than a lot of folks in spite of it.  \n\"His reasons for self-harm are stupid.\" Seriously? In what way? He's had his mother figure crucified in front of him, had a close friend betray him and sell him into slavery at which point he was trafficked and used as a sex toy, gaslit, beaten, branded, and loads of other shit.  \n\"His relationship with the FMC is repulsive.\" What? Why? In my and a lot of other opinions I've managed to scrape up, it's beautiful and tender.  \n\"He should honestly die.\" UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURGH.  \n\"This project was a shitstorm from the start and I've no confidence in it at all moving forward.\" \\*angry emoji\\*  \nThat's just a sample of the negative feedback I've gotten.\n\nFurthermore, I'm having other issues. Possibly projection ones. I've started to question myself (my characters question themselves too about the same literal thing), \"are they even allowed the intimacy they get later?\" Reason tells me, \"YES, OF COURSE!\" etc. But like, idk how to explain it. Some of you probably get what I'm saying. Like, \"okay, how is it possible for something meant to be safe and beautiful to be that after it's been so damn mangled, tainted, and butchered?\" And then there's questions like, \"Sexuality is gross.\"  \nYeah, my characters are sex-repulsed like me, but the thing is...I WANT them to be able to share intimacy with each other without feeling so bad about it. (Context, they wait to have sex until they feel ready enough for it and it happens slow with questions and reassurances and breaks throughout the, uh, process.)  \nI want them to have their babies. I want them to have that kind of happiness (even though they'll be happy apart from it bc, let's face it, there's WAY more to life than just sex).\n\nI don't give a rat's ass if I don't get that. Truly. I \\*\\*\\*prefer/want\\*\\*\\* to stay single, and I'm possibly asexual. But the...subject is nonetheless tainted for me too.\n\nAnyway, I don't even know what to do at this point. Maybe this was a stupid and painful-only endeavor after all.... :(\n\nSorry if I sound so mad. My PTSD is also getting pressed by other things....\n\nOnly thing keeping me from blowing up even more rn is listening to Stand My Ground by Within Temptation on loop...."

    "content": "I lost my younger brother when he was only 30 in 2016. Two years later I had the ptsd diagnosis while in the hospital. I tried to see a couple of therapists but I really hated it. I hated sitting there and reliving the whole thing and even worse, feeling like the therapist wasn't even listening to me. I kinda just gave up.\n\nThis really took over my life and contributed to my divorce. My ex would always tell me I needed to go back into therapy or he would be done. Whenever I would hear this from him or feel like he was angry with me, I just shut down. Sometimes I wonder if he thought I didn't care but that wasn't the case at all. I just got to such a low point that I was convinced I was a burden.\n\nI won't have insurance for much longer now that the divorce is almost complete so I'm seeing a therapist while I can. She seems to be more knowledgeable than any of the therapists I had in the past. \n\nShe told me that more recent research shows the traditional methods of treatment just weren't effective. She described how trauma is an automatic nervous response and we can't control it. It can also exacerbate other issues like my ADHD, which explains a lot in itself. \n\nShe described a technique we are starting next week called trauma tapping. The gist is that trauma is activated on one side of the brain. This technique activates the amygdala and gets the other side of the brain to react so that we still have the ability of logical thought when we are exposed to a trigger. By having both sides of the brain activated instead of the side that handles trauma, we are better able to regulate ourselves and not go into a panic attack.\n\nI've gone through the past few years believing I must be a terrible person because I can't get help. But I REALLY didn't want to see a new therapist and tell my story all over again. With this lady I haven't had to do that at all. She says research shows the old method of having patients describe the trauma in detail has turned out to actually be horrible, not helpful. \n\nHearing this almost kind of woke me up. \"Wait so I'm not a complete dirtbag incapable of caring? It was always a nervous system response beyond my control?\" For once in a long time I'm actually eager for our session so I can see if I get results. I blame myself for contributing so much to my divorce, but now I feel like it was something I was never going to get control of until meeting the right therapist. I mean, the last therapist I had would do phone calls and I could hear him driving around while talking to me. Therapy doesn't seem like the time to have divided attention. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnyone else try this technique? Sorry idk if this is a rant or a post looking for advice.

I feel the need to share the things I went through because I haven't really talked about it to anyone and hoping that maybe it can provide some relief because I don't feel comfortable sharing with those around me. Preface when I started this relationship I was 22 years old and he was 28. We grew up together as his parents were basically family to me and his sisters were my best friend. I always had a little crush on him growing up but was really insecure when I entered the relationship. Since then I've worked a lot on myself but consider myself to be asexual because of trauma response I have developed since our relationship.\n\nThese are the things that I experience from my PTSD that pop into my head. PTSD is strange in that random things can trigger it and you have no control of the memory (Sorry about any typos, this was initially a note I made for myself because writing is something I use to help me process things):\n\n* The comments he made about my dad and mom (about them having sex) that were completely inappropriate and the amount of times that he had made them despite expressing how uncomfortable it made you just for him to constantly do it. It got to an excessive point where it became something we constantly fought about and always resulted in him calling me uptight.\n* The time I had sex with him at my sisters because he wouldn\u2019t leave me alone even though I asked him not to because I was with family and then how he weaponised it against me later because said I said no to sex initially but then had sec regardless. His reasoning for forcing me other times was because he no longer believed I was telling the truth when I said no.\n* The time that I had literally just told him that I had been sexually assaulted just for him to grab me by the neck to the point I couldn\u2019t breathe and I nearly let him get away with it but then drove him home. Where on the whole ride home he blamed it on me and the fact that I was goth and how he misinterpreted the situation despite the several conversations of the fear of sex that I had with him before entering the relationship.\u00a0\n* The many time that he would make me suck his d\\*\\*\\* or else he would get mad or just in the middle of sex would just shove his d\\*\\*\\* in my mouth when lying down and then force it to the back of the throat till I was crying or about to throw up.\n* The time that he got out of the car because someone was being a jerk and cut you off because he was a \u201cmanly man\u201d despite that I asked him not to and just the fact that it was literally insane.\u00a0\n* His complete fascination with guns and how he talked about wanting kill someone.\n* The times that he begged me to take a shower with him every single day while house sitting for my parent and would just force me into sex or guilt trip me just because I was just flirting with him (not in a sexual way either but just because I was trying to be a good girlfriend) or because he did something nice for me.\n* How he used my openness to trying new things and having fun during sex as a way to guilt trip me for being a slut.\n* Forcing me to be on the phone with him every minute I wasn\u2019t in school and how I let that affect my grades.\n* Driving in my home city after we broke up and maybe seeing him behind me in his new car and having a full on panic attack and the realisation that I could never step foot in his families house ever again\n* How he told everyone that I cheated on him and my friends and family believed him over me\u00a0\n* When he told me that he would fuck his biological sister if he could\u00a0\n* How he never made an effort or had any interest in anything I actually did besides that I was smart\u00a0\n* The fact that he said he wishes that his niece was abused the same way he was because he thought it would be good discipline for her because she didn\u2019t say I love you too when he dropped her off for school\n* The fear that I felt every time he would get angry from the pacing and punching that he would do making me feel unsafe in those situations\n* The literal lunacy that was him telling lies about his therapist sexually assaulting him but when offering help how he stated he only wanted to see her because she was a good therapist and yelling at the planes that flew over the day that I broke up with him.\u00a0\n* The genuine fear I have to this day to come across him ever again\u00a0\n* The disappointment, disgust and shame I feel for letting someone do all these things to me because of the insecurity I felt about myself and how that lead to so much more trauma in my life and the way that people treat me when I let them in to anything that happened during the relationship making it clear that this is not something I can talk about to anyone in my life"

    "title": "Not knowing what to expect is a trigger for me (TW for abuse)",
    "content": "In working with my therapist, I've recently realized a commonality between a lot of the events that send me into tailspins and activate my fight-or-flight. Very often, the theme is that I don't know what to expect from an interaction with an individual, so my nervous system goes \"harm imminent; must prepare\". \n\n  \nUsually, this comes out in instances where I'm dealing with interpersonal issues and the other person doesn't respond. Like, if I say something like \"hey, there appears to be an issue between us consisting of XYZ; how can we address this and come to a resolution?\" and they don't say anything in response, there is something so deeply, deeply embedded in my psyche that takes that to mean that they are readying to harm me. It's the calm before the storm, so to speak. This originates from trauma with my dad, who used to always go completely silent right before he'd >!pull out his gun !<or  >!beat the hell out of me!<. And it was always immediately following instances where I tried to advocate for myself or bring up an issue. I had a different abuser, too, who would always go completely silent before doing something awful, so that, for me, is just always there in those prolonged silences. They are terrifying, even if there is no solid reason for them to be at this point.\n\n  \nI know I can't *make* people talk to me, and I don't want to be disrespectful of anyone or their boundaries. But especially when I'm bringing up conflict or an issue with someone, I am always so afraid that they're gonna harm me when they just say nothing and stonewall (and I will call it stonewalling, since I express myself clearly, ask for a response/clarity, and am able to see that they read those messages), such that these interactions - or lack thereof - *become* traumatic, themselves. My nervous system is waiting for the blow to come, waiting to fight or run, and living in that space around these kinds of people is incredibly stressful. Please, I do not care how impolite you are in addressing me; I do not care if you dislike me or if you have some grade-A smack to talk about me. Cuss me out, yell at me, tell me you hate me with every fiber of your being, but please say *something*. \n\n  \nMainly, it's a situation at work/school with a colleague. I have gotten the sense since I met this person that they have just outright hated me from the start. I have tried to build a rapport with them, tried to establish some kind of connection there so that I can work with them without issue, but their cold body language/tone/facial expressions/passive aggressive little comments/scoffing/eye rolling/judgmental remarks have all persisted. I do not trust them at all because I find them incredibly unpredictable. Once in a blue moon, they'll act like we're besties and wave at me or like a bunch of my social media posts, all the while ignoring the actual attempts to address this issue. And having to work with them, as I have in the past, has led me to completely shut down and go nonverbal in their presence. I have always left those interactions early, without fail. I've brought this up multiple times, thinking *ok, maybe they just aren't aware they're coming off this way and it's all a big misunderstanding.* They've not responded to any of those attempts to address it, so I'm just increasingly distressed even being in the same room as them because I don't know what to expect. The not knowing what to expect has me in this constant state of fight-or-flight near them, so I've been avoiding them. Unfortunately, this also means avoiding many of the spaces and communities I otherwise would have loved to be part of and connected to, but I don't feel like I can safely be in those environments because all my brain can focus on is *where are they, where are the exits to this place, do not get near me, what will I do if \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* and that's exhausting; I no longer derive any joy from those communities or experiences because my body won't stop acting like there's a predator afoot.\n\n  \nMaybe they are totally harmless and it *is* all a big misunderstanding. But I wish they'd communicate that and not leave me to guess - because my guess will always be \"they are going to harm me\" since that is the background I have to draw on. I understand I am not owed this communication and they are not responsible for my nervous system's responses to them, but I will still continue to be terrified around them and avoid any instances where they might be till I know I am not in danger. Unfortunately, that means not going to a lot of things, which is becoming isolating. \n\n  \nI'm not sure how to tackle this. Thoughts?"

    "content": "In therapy we have reached the point of touching on exposure therapy. I didn't think I needed it, because I will just go into situations even if a bit uncomfortable, it was never a big deal. I realize now that that is because I was dissociating and now, everything is unravelling in my life where I don't feel comfortable doing anything where everything has some level of more intense discomfort. \n\nI was the one to check out new places, interact with people, talk to the waitress or the cashier, just make a phone call to a place, go dance on the street to music with others. Addressing some issues with avoiding work related spaces and now I have realized I was dissociating through it all my whole life. It feels like everything is beginning to unravel in my life and that I am trudging through mud that keeps rising higher and higher. \n\nI'm now reluctant to leave my house, I'm reluctant to interact with anyone besides one person in my life. I don't want to interact, or be perceived. \n\nExposure therapy work is now me actively trying to be mindful and ground myself back while then battling the slew of negative emotions and thoughts that send me into ungrounded states. I am EXHAUSTED. Life goes on so I still need to go out and do certain things but now that I am aware of how I have been interacting with the world this whole time, I feel even more alienated and strange. \n\nMy anxiety and depression is still low overall, coming up situationaly to reasonable triggers. I still do things around the house. Most medications end up having side effects that worsen the dissociation by further emotional numbing. I'm contraindicated for anything that effects heart rate including things slowing rate heart. \n\nNot sure what to do or where to go from here. When I talk about all this I tend to hear \"this is beyond my scope\" and the like, or \"what you are feeling is normal, our society is sick.\" The latter is great and all, but where do I go from here? I'm having a harder and harder time surviving and in trying to make things better it feels like I have opened a Pandora's box of issues. "

    "content": "I'm autistic, so growing up I was always criticized and punished severely in school just for being myself. My self esteem was destroyed and I basically threw everything about me away so I could be an empty, depressed shell and fit in with the rest of the sheep. \n\n(US public schools are extremely ableist. It's like you're a square being shoved through a circular hole by force, and if you don't like it then you get punished and diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder. Special Ed here is a fucking joke.)\n\nWhen I was a kid I used to really be into art, I loved drawing and I even used to win 1st place in contests sometimes. But ever since then, I was always made to feel like nothing I ever did was right or good enough and that I was forever destined to be the black sheep that didn't deserve to be happy or at peace with themselves.\n\nSo I completely gave up drawing and stopped practicing for years. Not being in school anymore as an adult didn't change that mentality.\n\nI could've been so good by now, but instead I'm starting over from scratch and I still have so much internalized hate and shame for myself that I can't even finish a basic sketch before immediately giving up and \"saving it for later\"....I've never had a sketch book that wasn't just wasted paper.\n\nIf I'm not good at something right away then that ends up being a reflection of me, even though I know I shouldn't be feeling that way or expecting to be perfect on my 1st try. I'm still not used to not being \"gifted\" anymore.\n\nGaming was my escapism for a while, but creative life sim genres are my favorite (ACNH, Minecraft, anything that gives you a lot of creative freedom to express yourself), which also sends me down the social media rabbit hole of comparing my work to others and impulsively deleting my save files. Taking a break and switching to other types of games doesn't help.\n\nI could play a game for years, have countless hours built up on my switch, and not have a single save to show for it. \n\nNow I'm stuck in a horrible cycle of slowly killing myself with dopamine (smoking weed, binge eating, watching brain rot to avoid thinking, phone scrolling, bedrotting) to procrastinate my greatest fear (happily expressing myself in a safe, creative environment with no one around to judge or make fun of me for it).\n\nIt doesn't make sense for me to avoid something I've always wanted, but the main issue besides the shame is just straight up not knowing who I am anymore since I turned myself into a blank slate and shut my brain off. Being blank isn't an empowering opportunity for redemption to me.\n\nWhat if I finally managed to build the perfect virtual world or finish the best art project ever, just for it to still not feel \"right\" or \"me\"? What if nothing ever brings me happiness or closure and I'm stuck self loathing forever?? I also have extreme commitment issues from being forced to move all the time.\n\nNo matter how hard I try to redeem myself and succeed in life in other aspects, my creative \"purpose\" still proves to be the bane of my existence. Sometimes I wish I could have a free trial of death (not just closing my eyes to sleep) and see if that would be truly worse than living like this..."

Just being mentally and physically abused it took a toll on me and I had no idea at all. I had no one to talk to at all and I just tried to shift my focus by fitting in school. That just made shit even more worse.\n\nI just dealt with the same neglect and embarrassment and shame as I did at home. And I\u2019ve been having constant unwanted flashbacks of the trauma in eighth grade. I was ashamed of who I was as a person so I acted differently than who I was to have people I could rely on to forget about the abuse. I fucked up badly. I was just making shit worse for myself and now I\u2019m ashamed of how I acted to forget about the abuse at home. I\u2019m incredibly ashamed about this but this one time I joked around with my friend saying fatty patty at first he laughed but when I said it again he said he was gonna smack my mouth. I never meant any harm at all. I had no support during this time and I was dealing with so much abuse I did anything to make friends. This other time, back then I used to act tough to Impreza people because I cared what people thought about me because I was Ahmed of who I was and a person because of the abuse and this one time I joked around with someone who I thought was my friend and was like fuck you up. I meant no harm but I was an idiot but he was with his actual friend and he yells  stfu at me. I was traumatically embarrassed. It reminded me of all the belittling and yelling and constant neglect I was receiving at home for no reason. I meant no harm all I just wanted to have friends to forget about the abuse but all I received back was the same treatment I was getting at home and it just made my mental health even more worse and I feel ashamed  as a  person for making those mistakes of fitting in to forget about the abuse at home.I feel like I\u2019m the problem.\n\n\nMy mental health got even more fucked up as years go by. I\u2019m not even the same anymore. I can\u2019t focus at all I barely eat I could barely even function and been dealing with anxiety and depression since freshman year because of all the abuse. Now I\u2019m failing school because of all the stress and just the motivation and focus it\u2019s all gone. I could barely even focus in school because I\u2019m always on edge. I always think something bad will happen and I\u2019m always worrying. Ever since freshman year I\u2019ve been having constant unwanted traumatic memories and flashbacks about past and ongoing home and school trauma roan in my head which gives me significant distress. My heart and chest gets this weird feeling to the point where I could barely even breathe. This is an everything thing and it just won\u2019t stop. And all this is happening while I have to go to school. I barely even do anything because I just can\u2019t focus and I lost all my love for school because of all the abuse and trauma I\u2019ve endured at home and school. Everything around me triggers these traumatic memories and the people I have to look at and see everyday triggers them.\n\n\nA lot of people contributed to the trauma and abuse but for the mental and physical abuse it\u2019s from my grandmother and aunt. My grandmothers boyfriend also played a huge role to the domestic violence and abuse which is why I chose to not say anything to him and just not be around him. I\u2019m currently failing school because I just can\u2019t function at all and anxiety and depression hit me badly. Every single day my grandmother gets these messages of me coming to school late and just antagonizes me about it. The more she does that the more I feel less about myself. Now, she has gotten messages of me failing my classes and now trying to ask me why am I failing what\u2019s going on with me like she\u2019s not enduring me in all this abuse and being constantly hostile and disrespectful with me for no fuckjng reason. They expect me to be good in school but they\u2019re enduring me in all this abuse. I barely even feel safe here.\n\n\n\nEspecially if it\u2019s just my aunt and me. She has this thing where because of one small situation goes on a rampage and goes crazy in the house attacking me throwing stuff banging stuff just going crazy. And they\u2019re confused why I\u2019m failing school. This specific situation with my grandmothers boyfriend that really just urkes me because it makes me realize I\u2019ve been abused and taken advantage of so fucking much and I just acted like it was nothing because I was too scared to talk to anybody about the abuse and I tried to act like it\u2019s nothing even though it\u2019s a very big deal . But freshman year my grandmother with her usual antics and started antagonizing me and she asked me about a slip and I didn\u2019t know what she was talking about so I asked to clarify and all of a sudden her boyfriend pressed me and started to threaten me saying he don\u2019t care if the cops come and slammed the door on me. Next morning I\u2019m the dark he woke me up in a fucking military suit and forced me against my will to do all these exercises and drills like I\u2019m on beyond scared straight. I was incredibly traumatized. All this abuse really affected me and it\u2019s all coming to haunt me now and it\u2019s the fact that the mental and physical abuse is still continuing. I really be thinking there\u2019s something wrong with me to be enduring In all this abuse."

    "content": "# Sexual abuse is a horrific and traumatic experience that can have long-lasting effects on a survivor's life. One of the most common outcomes of sexual abuse is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a mental health condition that can develop after a person has been exposed to a traumatic event or series of events. PTSD can have a significant impact on a survivor's daily life, relationships, and overall well-being.Individuals who have experienced sexual abuse may struggle with intrusive thoughts, memories, and flashbacks of the traumatic event. These symptoms can be triggered by various stimuli, such as physical touch, certain smells, or situations that remind the survivor of the abuse. As a result, survivors may experience heightened levels of anxiety, fear, and distress, making it difficult for them to feel safe and secure in their [surroundings.In](http://surroundings.In) addition to intrusive thoughts and memories, survivors of sexual abuse may also experience emotional numbness, avoidance behaviors, and hypervigilance. Emotional numbness can manifest as a disconnection from one's emotions and difficulty expressing feelings or forming attachments with others. Avoidance behaviors may involve avoiding certain places, people, or activities that remind the survivor of the abuse. Hypervigilance is a state of increased arousal and alertness, where the survivor is constantly on edge and scanning their environment for potential threats. Furthermore, sexual abuse can impact a survivor's relationships with others, including family members, friends, and romantic partners. Survivors may struggle with trust issues, intimacy challenges, and difficulties in forming and maintaining healthy relationships. They may also experience feelings of shame, guilt, and self-blame, which can contribute to a sense of isolation and loneliness.It is important for survivors of sexual abuse to seek help and support from mental health professionals, such as therapists, counselors, and support groups. Therapy can help survivors process their trauma, develop coping strategies, and learn how to manage their symptoms of PTSD. Medication may also be prescribed to help manage symptoms of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances.In conclusion, sexual abuse can have a profound impact on a survivor's life, leading to symptoms of PTSD and other mental health challenges. It is crucial for survivors to seek help and support in order to heal from their trauma and regain a sense of safety and well-being. With proper treatment and support, survivors can learn to cope with their symptoms and move forward in their recovery journey.\u00a0[\u00a0](https://www.my-story.vip/)"

    "content": "I was in an abusive relationship for 2 years and got out a little less than a year ago. I didn't feel too terrible afterwards, I didn't really feel traumatized, I was pretty indifferent. I had mentally checked out of that relationship 6 months before it ended but he basically wouldn't let me break up with him. I would have the occasional nightmare or flashback, but I was able to kinda push it out of my mind. I mean I do have triggers, but I just avoided those. I've been in therapy this whole time and I've been trying to avoid the topic. I would avoid it when I was still with him because I thought it was my own problem and I was also embarrassed. After the fact, I just felt like not talking about it and trying to forget would be best. Well, I have been having flashbacks and nightmares every few days for the past month, and have been extremely paranoid and anxious and its been getting worse and worse. She told me I probably have PTSD but I don't understand how. I thought time heals all wounds, so why is it now getting bad? She told me I need to talk it over but the idea of that is scary, I've been stressing about it since our last session. I don't know if I can talk about it like that. I'd rather not tell anyone how it was. \n\nI was kinda dumb and started dating again pretty soon after. I met my now boyfriend about a month or so after I was finally able to break things off fully (we were no contact for a month prior to me finally being able to end it). Me and him clicked instantly and became really good friends, then started dating. He's a wonderful and kind man. I wish I knew that I would be as affected by it as I am. I genuinely thought I was fine and processed everything while still in the relationship and in the month of no contact/month after. \n\nBut now I'm dealing with this. I'm sure he's noticed I've been a bit off these past few weeks, but how do I tell him \"hey I'm sorry but I actually have PTSD\" and have him understand? He knows my ex was abusive but I don't think he realizes how bad it was and how bad it apparently affected me. I'm afraid he will get upset and tell me I shouldn't have started dating if I have this. I cant stress it enough, I really had no idea that I was as affected as I was and I wouldn't have purposely dragged someone into a situation like this. The last thing i want to do is mess things up with him. I can't just uproot my whole life since things are getting bad, that will probably make things so much worse. I'm doing all I can to make sure that I don't hurt my boyfriend. I keep reminding myself that he is not my ex. He doesn't think like him, he doesn't act like him, he doesn't look like him. I know I'm safe with him, he has shown me time and time again that he is trustworthy and has a kind heart, so I don't know why I'm still afraid of him. \n\nIts weird because I do trust him for the most part. My body doesn't though. Like I could want him to do something or he could do something that in theory- I'd enjoy, but are a trigger. My body just reacts. I just start feeling so trapped and helpless and scared and anxious that I go into my own head and think about all the bad things my ex did. Something as simple as cleaning makes me freak out. My boyfriend loves to clean and I have really bad anxiety around cleaning that only got worse with my ex. Every time he suggests we clean up a little I just get so anxious even though I want to do it. He always tries to make it fun by being silly and playing music but I always end up shutting down. BUT I WANT TO DO IT! I know he isn't going to belittle me or ridicule me, but why do I react as if he already has? He could come in and tell me \"oh wow, good job!\" And ill immediately think that he doesn't mean it and is just making fun of me. HE IS NOT. I don't understand why I'm like this and its so frustrating. He tells me I'm beautiful ALL the time. He has never done anything to make me think or feel otherwise. Part of my brain thinks he's lying. There are some times all I can think about is how ugly I look and that he feels the same way. It happens alot when we're being intimate and its terrible. Its horrible that I don't believe him. I want to belive him, I want to be happy with him without having that little voice in my head telling me these things. I genuinely love this man and I am so angry with myself that I cannot fully believe anything he says. And I know thats on me and it hurts. I've been trying to act normal, I haven't told him that I've been thinking like this. I need to figure it out on my own and its not fair for him to know that. I feel like that's upsetting to hear. \n\nI feel like I'm at war with my brain. I'm constantly shutting down terrible thought after terrible thought. I know that what I'm thinking and feeling is wrong, but I don't know how to stop it. I have never experienced my mind working against me so horribly. I am autistic and have experienced alot of bullying and maltreatment which has left me with trauma, if I ignore that stuff then the anxiety goes away. I have always been self conscious, but nothing like this. I feel like everything is against me. \n\nWhat the fuck do I do? I'm so confused and stressed out. I know I probably should talk about it with my therapist but I don't want to relive that. Ive told her the basics but idk, I just don't want to talk about it. \n\nAlso, how exactly do I talk about this with my boyfriend. I feel like he should atleast know that I'm dealing with this. How do I explain that I have no idea why its only really becoming an issue now? I dont want him to get the impression that I'm hung up on my ex and missing him or some bullshit like that. I mean, I guess I'm still hung up on the fact that I was abused for 2 years and was manipulated to be convinced it was my fault. \n"

Thing is, I can't help but feel like she's right sometimes and sometimes these situations make me want to 1-up her. She was SAed when she was maybe 7, but raised by a loving family, then beaten by her wife and eventually nearly killed by her wife stabbing her with a knife and lost her child to the court system. I was abused both emotionally and physically as a child,  there were a few times the abuse could have killed me as a child, I was SHed as a teenager, and SAed as a barely adult (first time was at 18, 2nd was last year at 27), but what really set off my ptsd was one intense incident of plain old harassment (not sexual or physical) so that's all I would tell a new therapist when I first saw them and got brushed off so many times that it took me 6 years to get a ptsd diagnosis. My condition was also made worse by emotional abuse that continued into adulthood. I  still feel like she's kinda right, I was never stabbed or really attacked with anything that would traditionally be called a 'weapon' and I was never physically abused BY MY LIFE PARTNER, or SAed AS A CHILD, and I certainly don't know anything about what it's like to loose a child in any way, I don't have one. The fact that I still have ptsd and she doesn't makes me feel really pathetic too. Seriously, she doesn't have ptsd, my therapist,  her therapist,  me, and her all have explored the question and all still don't think she has it. Questions are welcome and I would like some advice. "

Basically, for example, a while back my brother was in a crazy situation with a few of his friends where one of them was being SAd by their partner at the time. As far as I\u2019m aware my brother is okay and that friend\u2019s partner is at least at a distance from them but my brother still checks the abuser\u2019s twitter frequently to make sure he\u2018s not doing anything crazy or planning anything, since he used to harass my brother and his other unrelated friends too.

During this event, I witnessed multiple homicides, including that of the first responding police officer and the shooter. I did not think I would live through this event, but I did.\n\nIn the direct aftermath of this event, my friends and community came together to support me. I could tell everyone really cared about me, and I could also tell that no one had any actual reference point for the level of violence I encountered and the horrible things I witnessed. For them, these things are still unimaginable and still so intangible. It has been both beautiful to see how much my friends care about me, and also very isolating to see how impossible it is for them to understand what happened to me. \n\nThe 20 minutes I spent embroiled in this near death experience changed my life and my view of the world completely. Everyone else is in the same world they were in before. Enough time has passed that for many of my friends, what happened to me has faded from their minds somewhat. But it is still affecting me everyday, and it is painful to hear people close to me talk gleefully about reading a murder mystery, watching a police procedural, playing a gun centered video game, or referencing horrible news items with a cynical humor. Like, for me, murder is not something that is only in entertainment, and giving (retraumatizing) evidence to the police isn't something that only exists in movies, and it never will be again. It is something that I lived through first hand and which is truly, truly awful.. \n\nThis past Monday, I completed a PHP (Partial Hospitalization Program) for my PTSD symptoms from this event. Before going, I was having nightmares, stress vommitting, having intruisive memories and flashbacks multiple times daily. I was able to do the basic things I needed to in order to keep alive-- report to job, do my laundry, cook food, take out trash. But I was not able to do any of the things that make life enjoyable at all. The PHP really helped with my physiological symptoms and I'm grateful for that and how it has expanded my capacity to interact with my life. I am now able to encounter triggers without feeling like the event is happening again. I am able to see a picture of a gun without having a panic attack.\n\n But, the work that I did in the PHP did not alleviate my feelings of isolation and I'm unsure of how to navigate this. The blas\u00e9 attitude that people have about the news of mass shootings and gun violence and violence in general, and the callous jokes that people make about violence and murder, and the prominent spot that murder and guns have in entertainment remain very painful for me. I do not see these things changing and I'm unsure of where my place in this world is. With my close friends I feel able to have conversations about this and how it is hard for me. But with coworkers, and etc, I don't feel able to and I don't feel interested in being vulnerable and sharing what I went through. It feels really hard. \n\n  \nWith this post, I'm not even really looking for advice. I just wanted to be able to say it, and hear if other people have the same issue. I don't want to feel alone anymore. If you can help, please help. If not, that is ok. "

My parents are divorcing and dad is an alcoholic, I had to physically stop him from killing himself and quickly after that I got cheated on in a starting relationship with a very mentally unstable girl. There was one violent event on New year involving me and my father which made me go completely insane. That's when my psychologist recommended psychiatric treatment. I had to quit Kratom which I was very dependent on for 1.5 years and probably caused alot of issues on it's own.\n\nI was perscribed Zoloft, Pregabalin, Trazodone (for sleep) and recently Quetiapine for night terrors.\n\nDuring the first stage of taking the meds I tried to cope with my PTSD by watching extreme g\\*re. Now I kinda feel like it was more of a self-harm. It's been around 10 months of me taking the medication but I still have big issues with anxiety and hypervigilance. It's hard for me to date someone since I'm constantly scanning my surroundings and fear that they will get hurt or attacked, it's hard for me to find a job because the longer I spend on the way to work the more energy the hypervigilance consumes (I currently do freelancing mostly from home).\n\nWith my medication, really horrible nightmares came, it started slow but now they happen quite frequently, almost everynight. It kills my whole day sometimes and I find it hard to function normally.\n\nWhen I encounter a direct reminder of my PTSD I go haywire and have to fight myself to not be agressive, then I suffer for the rest of the week which includes flashbacks, night terrors and overall a very bad mood. This is also a reason I carry we\\*\\*ons on me (all legally acquired). They actually help me feel a bit better when outside but I know how extreme this solution it is.\n\nI sometimes drink and rarely smoke w\\*\\*d when I go outside with my friends because if I'm not at least a bit drunk I cannot let my guard down and calm down to actually enjoy the time with them. I also smoke when going somewhere which also makes me a bit calmer but still it's just a toxic bandage on a bleeding wound.\n\nThe meds helped me go from completely insane to socially acceptable stability but inside I feel like something is very wrong, almost beyond a point of no return wrong.\n\nPlease if you have any experience or advice write it down, I'm starting to give up again and don't know what to do next. If you have any experience with therapy or just similar diagnosis/experience feel free to share it.\n\n(P.S. English is not my first language)."

    "content": "Hello everyone,\n\ni just created this account because i'm in serious need of advice, and i don't know anymore who I can even talk to due to my increasing trust issues.\n\nI'm 24 years old and got c-ptsd with severe symptoms in the past, which let to uncountable hospital stays my whole youth up to a year ago. I finally got to do an intense trauma therapy which actually helped a lot, and in that euphoria of finally feeling better I decided to just move across the country so I could \"start a new life\" (what an odd thing to think). Since I couldn't afford a own flat i looked for a room in a shared one and actually found some really nice people. Seriously, I love them, I never thought I could have that much luck in my life - BUT\n\naround 2 months ago my symptoms started to come back. Of course, how naive could I be to even dare to think I could have been cured. I get a lot of flashbacks again which lead me to breaking down, I am incredible depressed, got problems with taking care of my body, and so on. I barely leave the house except for university. The worst part is my enormous paranoia. I am scared of anyone, i can't trust anyone - it's the worst with my flatmates.  I have to listen for a few minutes if there's really no one out of their rooms so i can go to the toilette and so on. I am scared they just hate me at this point and something bad will happen soon, even though i rationally don't think this is true. But maybe they will one day if i keep acting that weird and all over the place. And now that's the thing i want to talk about:\n\nI did not tell them about the severity of my health condition when i applied for this room. I just did not want some strangers to know how bad I was doing - I though it was over! And now I feel so guilty. They should have not let me move in, because no one wants such a messed up person in the place they're living in. But I guess I have to cope with this situation now, so, was anyone in a similar situation? How were you guys doing, if you happened to live in a shared flat some time as well? How could I go on? Like, they surely noticed I'm doing bad, but how do you explain such things? I just can't tell them about all those horrible things, not talking about the traumatic experiences itself, but more about how it affects my whole life.\n\nThanks for listening, I would be so happy if anyone could give me some advice."

My partner at the time obviously knew all about this and was present for my therapy journey. He told me in detail how he'd had sex with this other woman. I know this may sound absurd but my brain has related this encounter to him having actually raped me. I keep seeing myself in the scenario but it isn't consensual.

My boss said: \"Our expectations regarding your work, and your role, will not be lowered simply because of your diagnosis. I will hold you to the same standards of success like the rest of my employees who do not have your diagnosis.\" Fine, that's fair. I get that. However, what my boss said next slightly alarmed me: \"If you continue to struggle with achieving goals related to your job, we might need to start thinking about whether or not your job - your role - is the right fit.\"\n\nNothing else. \n\nIn hindsight, I wished my boss stated something along the lines of: \"If we see that you are productive, we will move you to another role that will better accommodate your diagnosis.\" The fact that my boss didn't even say anything like this is - worrying to say the least.\n\nIs my boss's statement normal for a situation like this? Or problematic? \n\nFor people who are unable to quit their jobs due to financial concerns, but had a less-than-understanding boss like mine, how did you cope and continue your job in order to put food on the table?\n\nI am going to succeed out of spite now.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you so much, everyone, for all of your encouragement and support. I no longer feel alone, and I feel heard and understood. The bad news is: I can't just quit because I am the main breadwinner in my family right now, and I need to stay in this job for as long as I can to support my loved ones financially. It's emotionally and mentally exhausting to pretend that I like my boss in the office, especially when my boss continuously makes tone-deaf statements about my \"lack of interpersonal skills\" as someone with PTSD, but I am also reaching a point in my life in which I am starting to feel more self-confident about myself and about my skillsets as a professional. I am feeling mentally and emotionally stronger every day, and I am not going to let my boss stop me from being successful at this job. Kill em with kindness, as people always say.

That was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, compounded with childhood SA (from a cousin).\n\nAt first, I tried to drink it away and tough it out. That carried on until about 2022. Then the dissociative fugues started. Around that time, I met a friend (not saying the city), and we became physically involved. She eventually urged me to seek help and stop drinking. Oddly enough, she knew lots of great books on PTSD recovery. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79\n\nThe day after I went to a shrink, she broke up with me\u2014winter of 2022. At the time, it really hurt. I didn\u2019t know then that she also had PTSD and couldn\u2019t deal with her trauma and mine at the same time. So I sobered up, focused on physical fitness, and poured myself into life-affirming things.\n\nFast forward to summer 2023. Out of the blue, I got an email from her asking how I was doing\u2014and asking for advice about a career change.\n\nWe started corresponding again, and by spring of 2024, we met in person. Over the course of the year, she opened up to me more and more. I knew how big of a deal it was for her to trust me with her PTSD\u2014it\u2019s like holding a baby unicorn.\n\nYes, our friendship has had its highs and lows, and that used to bother me. But then I realized: it\u2019s the PTSD. It\u2019s hard for her to believe someone could love her unconditionally, with patience and no judgment. So, very often, she tests me\u2014to see if I\u2019ll stay.\n\nI tried to gently convince her to see a professional, but she said, \u201cI\u2019m not weak, and I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nNow, she\u2019s going through an early mid-life crisis, and I\u2019ve been there for her\u2014not to fix her, but to hurt with her. She calls me her angel. \ud83e\udd79\n\nI won\u2019t lie\u2014it\u2019s hard. We\u2019ll make really good progress, and then the PTSD kicks in. Recently, there were horrific events in her city. When you compound that with financial pressures, there\u2019s only so much a person can take. She\u2019s letting her protector/persecutor persona run the show now. The lights are on, but no one\u2019s home.\n\nI do what I can to help\u2014emotionally, spiritually, and financially\u2014but always in a way that respects her autonomy. I never let her feel obligated.\n\nShe is my best friend in the world, and I\u2019m so worried about her. I\u2019ll keep being her rock, but something\u2019s got to give before everything breaks.\n\nIf for some reason she\u2019s reading this:\nYou are loved. You are cherished.

    "title": "A Story of Healing from PTSD",
    "content": "Hello amazing community. I wanted to share my story in the hopes that it can help at least one of you. After  10+ years of struggling with chronic stress, insomnia, crippling anxiety, eating disorders and even a digestive disorder that was AWFUL and so embarrassing (all the result of a traumatic event when I was 24 + cumulative childhood traumas)... I am so happy to report that I. am. fully. healed. I never thought this was possible. I've had the darkest days, for YEARS had dark days. My healing didn't happen overnight. It was an 18mo journey, but after about 6mo I saw a lot of improvement so I kept going. And I have to keep at it every damn day bc healing is a lifelong endeavor I've found.\"\n\nSo, how did I heal from PTSD?\n\nSomeone recently told me that \"everyone heals in their own language\" and I loved that. Bc I had to try a BUNCH of things before I found my medicines. And only a few of them made an impact that was noticeable day-to-day... most of them were obvious only after reflecting and looking back and saying things like \"woah, that work drama didn't send me into a downward spiral this time\" or \"my kids bad behavior didn't make me flip out\" bc that was my life before. \n\nI started my healing journey with traditional talk therapy. I am blessed bc I had insurance that would cover it to begin with, but then I decided to really invest in a GREAT therapist (goodbye, new clothing budget but it was worth every penny). She helped me a ton (based in California) by validating that my childhood was messed up, my partner was really abusive, etc + giving me tools and leading me in somatic experiencing practices and exposure therapy practices (all really good!) that moved the needle.\n\nI started doing yoga more, and read a TON of books, so many of which changed my life (You Can Heal Yourself, the Body Keeps the Score, the Law of One, Start Here: Understanding Narcissism, The Codependent Child, etc).\n\nBut I still felt my trauma INSIDE OF ME. If that makes sense. It still reared it's ugly head. I was still struggling on and off with digestive issues and sleepless nights and anger explosions and anxiety. It was getting better, but it was still there. \n\nThen my older brother (a 4x Iraq war veteran with PTSD) told me about therapeutic psychedelic medicines and how he had done some sessions. He started with mushrooms, then ayahuasca, and both were really impactful. He tried ketamine too... but the organic medicines were the most impactful for him.   \n  \nI was SO against these \"drugs\" you guys. I never did ANY drugs, other than alcohol (which began to be a problem for me so I cut way down on drinking). I was so judgmental. But I was also desperate. I wanted JOY and PEACE and LOVE and all the things that are my birthright. So I tried it. I found an INCREDIBLE healing group in the Bay Area that is super affordable and actually certified (who knew you could get trained on this?!!!) and helps you prepare before and then integrate after the experience. So I felt fully supportive. I'm actually still in contact with my care team there... Anyway, after my first dose there was a really meaningful shift. One that I could only describe as experiencing serenity for the FIRST TIME. I didn't wake up in a panic, I could take deep breaths and get through the day, it was really nice. \n\nAfter my third session, plus an ayahuasca experience with an AMAZING trained man in Denver, CO that really helped me trust men again (THAT was a big step!), all the digestive issues went away. I mean, completely away. I started sleeping so well that I had to set an alarm again! I woke up feeling so good you guys. It's hard to describe. \n\nThe people I worked with for mushrooms gave me a bunch of holotropic breathwork practices and meditations that I do every day. Plus affirmations that I say to myself in the mirror each morning (at first it was super cheesy but then they showed me the science on positive thinking and it works!). The breathwork really helps set me up each day, and so do the affirmations. \n\nAnyway, just sharing in case anyone is searching for HOPE. Healing can happen. Keep the faith. If you have questions, feel free to reach out to me - just reply and tag me here. I've been called to help others heal now, and encourage people out there that have suffered the way I did for so long. Blessings. \ud83d\udc95"

My therapist doesn\u2019t officially diagnose but believes I have PTSD as well. \n\nLast night was rough. We recently moved to an area that\u2019s not exactly prone to the LA wildfires, but we can be affected once in a while. Out of my MANY anxieties, one of them is having to make a quick escape in a fire with my cat, who is almost impossible to wrangle into a carrier and I always fear I\u2019d have to leave her behind. \n\nWe got an alert of a nearby fire and evacuation zones were getting closer and closer to us. The moment I realized this might be happening, I full on LOST it. Hyperventilating, crying, and what I do is I start hitting myself in the head because it\u2019s like I\u2019m trying to snap myself out of it. My husband has never seen me like that before because I had it very under control but this was beyond me. He was a saint though. Meanwhile my sister, who lives up the street, is blowing up my phone to get our go bags ready, pack up the car, and get ready to grab the cat. I\u2019m just\u2026 useless at this point. We got everything ready and got into bed. I didn\u2019t even change out of my clothes. \n\nWe are very lucky so far that the fire changed direction and we didn\u2019t have to evacuate. However it was a very long night with zero sleep as I furiously refreshed fire trackers and tried to get everything I could. I didn\u2019t sleep at all. All day today I\u2019ve been obsessively checking the fire maps. Every time my phone goes off, I think it\u2019s either a notification about a fire nearby, or my sister texting to say we gotta run.  \n\nNow it\u2019s time for bed\u2026 and I am so exhausted and desperately need to sleep. I just can\u2019t stop crying because I am so scared to get into bed again. My mind is racing, what if there\u2019s another flare up in the middle of the night? What if there\u2019s nothing but my anxiety is so bad that I don\u2019t sleep?\n\nI\u2019m breathing, I\u2019m doing mantras. I\u2019m trying to remind myself to be FREAKING GRATEFUL because so many people have lost their homes and I\u2019m sitting here crying for no reason. I am so scared this is going to stay with me for a while. \n\nI have Xanax prescribed that I rarely take. I took one last night and one again tonight. This is very unlike me, I usually have to toss the bottles because I don\u2019t finish them and they expire.\n\nLuckily I have my therapist appointment tomorrow but I just wanted to reach out and\u2026 get support, I guess? I feel terrible to feel this way. People have really suffered in this world. I am very fortunate. I wish I could take this ice pick out of my stomach.  "

From about the time I could walk, when this would happen I'd run down the road, often in the middle of the night I would run over the my Grandparents house down the road, in a rural are mind you, screaming, pissing myself pleading for them to stop him. Most of the time I would be to scared to go back home for a couple days, I'd stay with my grandparents for abit then be lulled into feeling safe to go back. I don't know how many times I went through that same process, I love my grandparents and they were really the only people that made me feel safe, but as an adult myself now, the same age my father was when all this happened, I don't understand and feel a sense of anger that they would let me go through with that over and over again.\n\nOn top of all that, something else happened that I think fucked my little mind up, and this is kind of dark, and Im sure it would make a few stomachs churn, I would classify this as Psychological abuse and torture. I've had problems with blocking this out a lot. When I was around 3-4, my father sat me up on the computer, and would show me gore pictures and videos. Yeah, I was in preschool. Pictures of suicides, pictures of murders, executions, a dude that accidentally boiled himself in a bath tub with a heating element. The violence was one thing, but I really think that pushed my mind over the edge, and at such a fucking young age, now I am older, I've had to process what sort of fucking sicko shows a child whos favourite passtime is Sesame Street and the wiggles, the most disgusting realities of humanity that even adults have trouble processing. Again, I've had trouble acknowledging this ever happened, I think its been the hardest to deal with because coming to realise any innocence I once had was taken away from me by my own father. Theres a certain feeling of betrayal that gives me that the violence did not. I only told my mother about this maybe 2 years ago. Its taken me a full 30 minutes to type this out.\n\nThe DV went on up until I started 2nd grade at about 5-6. My brother was about two years old then, and my mother told me she got to the point she feared one of them were going to end up murdering each other, she finally got the courage to move to a womens refuge in town. A couple days after she did that, our countries equivalent of Family Services came and took me and my brother away from my father while my grandparents were baby sitting us.\n\nMy fathers torment didnt end here. Through a court order, most of the remainder of my childhood I had to go visit him every two weeks. For a good 5 year period up until about 10, just getting gradually better as time went on, everytime I'd go to see my father, something would stuck up that fucks ass. Whether it was his rants about murdering my mother if she ever remarried or murdering my relatives if she ever brings me around them, or murdering any future siblings she might have with anyone. If it wasnt that, it was him reminding me how much of a dissapointment I was to him, he'd always try to show me how to do something, but end up getting emotionally abusive out of frustration, and he'd never realise my failure to absorb anything he taught me was his own doing. Most of the time he would have zero patience for me and that really made it hard for me to learn things in moments of adversity.\n\nI guess he was a hard ass on me up until I got to about 12 and started giving his shit back to him, and when I started ditching school and doing drugs I think some part of him just stopped doing whatever the fuck was going on in his brain.\n\nI guess I don't want to seek therapy through a subreddit, so I will leave it here. I guess I just want somebody to vent this to. The remainder of my story is filled with emotional instability, destructive behaviours of drug abuse, difficulty forming friendships and relationships, co-dependency. I've been through therapy since about 16, but I just don't think my brain has been actually ready to feel this shit surge through me until now. I'm trying to get these free appointments for a Trauma specialist from the government, just trying to be patient about that. I've always denied I have PTSD, but a part of me feels like I've been in denial because its been easier for me to just ignore it, and unfortunately the world just sort of tries to dictate what your own issues are, so try rub a little elbow grease into It and think \"ah, everything's fine\".\n\nBut I just keep following the same path of slowly destroying myself, trying to mask everything but I'm just so darn sick and tired of it. I want to love myself more, and I feel I'm ready to acknowledge I need help with that.\n\nIf youve gotten to the bottom of this, I don't expect a reply, Im grateful youve just taken the time to read this, but at the same time I would really appreciate any guidance or thoughts people would have on myself or my experiences. Thank you.\n\nEdit: Forgive some of the grammar mistakes lol. Also, I wanted to add dissociation has been a big part of my brains way of coping, Ive done this a lot especially as a kid, Im not sure what that changes though."

    "content": "I am stepping away from an EMDR session because I am too stimulated to continue and frankly I just needed to get this out. I hope in some way it can help you.\n\nI guess three years ago now I was diagnosed with PTSD, ultimately that was modified to C-PTSD. Although because of the DSM, blah blah blah, for insurance purposes it says something else. I don't know why that matters but it feels invalidating. They don't recognize my truth and they control my ability to get treatment.\n\nI did this thing called an Adverse Childhood Events or something. I scored a 10/10. I remember the first time I took it I told myself I was exaggerating or lying, trying to blame my parents at 47 years old. I reread the questions over and over and the memories just kept coming. It fractured my mind causing me to disassociate. It was very frightening.\n\nWhat I can tell you for sure is that for the first 18 years of my life everyday, I lived in fear and the things that were done to me over and over again, are unspeakable. Every imaginable offence. Most was done by others while my parents were neglecting me although they had their share of abuses too, neglect, abandonment, physical, phycological. My parents weren't evil their lives as children were hell too. My parents paid for my silence. Not intentionally, but through guilt we stayed in a negative contract for 45 years. I mismanage my life. They give me money. I am the problem.\n\nI couldn't break free of the cycle because I couldn't examine what had happened because I couldn't hold them accountable. That money has held me in guilt and shame my whole life. The money kept the abuse going. And now I don't know how to live without it. Even as I am capable of running a multi-million dollar company. I have traveled the world doing business and I don't know how to live outside of this dynamic because it's all I have ever known. No matter how much I've made it was never enough. I punished myself by selling everything I love to a pawn shop. My computers, my guitars, everything. That's how much I hated myself. I left myself with nothing. Because I was nothing.\n\nI have lost what it means to be me. I am fighting with every fiber of my being to figure it out. I understand mechanistically why all this happen. the Bayesian perspective if you will. How I couldn't have done anything else because I did what I knew. I understand how my amygdala is high jacking my responses because of the reduction in pre-frontal cortex. How I have neuronal groups that should have long ago processed into deeper parts of my memory but the taste, the smells, they are all there.\n\nKnowing hasn't helped the pain, the chaos, the overstimulation. Nor did the drugs. I can't take most because I get serotonin sickness. So my only hope is EMDR. I've read all the books, examined the case studies and believe in it. But the process is hard and the progress is slow. It's like lying on a table with a shattered femur and they put the bone back together one fragment at a time, while you are awake.\n\nI keep fighting and I'm tired of fighting. I hope you can relate."

These things were seemingly small but was ultimately me isolating myself, trying to hide from any reminder of the event. I stopped wearing makeup, I stopped wearing dresses, I stopped wearing form fitting clothes, and I stopped dancing.\n\nI have always been a freeze type, which I have only just figured out. I would freeze when my parents would fight, when I was assaulted, and now I freeze when I try to dance even when I'm alone. The feelings that come up are that I feel stupid, ugly, ridiculous, out of my depth, worthless, and disgusting.

I couldn't make out the room. It was all white and fuzzy. I had no memory of how I got to the room, when/why I was undressed, why there was blood or what happened afterwards. The only recollection I had is what I described. For a while (as a child) this memory confused me, all I knew was I hated being touched and had an intense fear of men. Now I do realize I was r\\*ped and feeling violated when someone touched me, & fearing men were PTSD responses. Still to this day however I can't remember how I got to that room, the active \"event\" or what really happened afterwards but that's beside the point. I was also on-and-off SA'd by the boys at my middle school from 11-12 years old until I dropped out.

For now I don't even have insurance or the funds to see a gyno but I know once I do get the option to go in it's going to be a crucial decision. Looking for some support here"

    "title": "Am I having flashbacks?",
    "content": "Hey all, so this is a tough one to explain. I\u2019ll take it from the beginning. I am currently a 24F. \n\nI\u2019ll begin by saying I have experienced trauma, but what I am about to describe may or may not be related. I have never been able to connect these \u201coccurrences\u201d to a specific event/memory.\n\nI have also consulted multiple doctors already. \n\nWhen I was 17, during class, I had my first \u201cflashback\u201d (that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be calling these \u201coccurrences\u201d since I have no other terminology to use). One second I was focusing on the lecture, the next, a feeling of familiarity\u2014similar to nostalgia but stronger\u2014started taking over my body.\n\nIt felt nice at first, like when you rewatch a movie you loved as a child for the first time as an adult\u2014comforting. I almost wanted to hold onto the feeling. I wasn\u2019t sure, though, what had triggered this or what I was even feeling nostalgic about. Then, the feeling grew and grew. I saw flashes of images (memories?) and kept telling myself, \u201cI need to remember what I\u2019m seeing,\u201d until the feeling was no longer pleasurable but instead painful. Overwhelming. The building joy and tingles had lasted maybe 30 seconds, and the proceeding discomfort felt to be the same.\n\nThe images, thoughts, and feelings that were blasting through my body slowly began to ease and fade, until the images and thoughts stopped completely. The feeling, however, lingered. It was weak, but it was there. It followed me for a few hours that day, but most times nowadays, it only follows me for a few minutes.\n\nThe weirdest part, though, was that after that feeling of overwhelm became too much to handle and I began to slowly calm down and settle back into myself, I quickly realized I had no memory of the images I had seen or the thoughts that I had had. I remembered that I had had them and that I wanted to remember them in that moment, but there was zero memory left of what they were. I had a vague memory of maybe being at my grandma\u2019s old house. I didn\u2019t feel sure of it, though. I felt as if maybe I was a child. Other than that, nothing.\n\nI told my mom about what happened that day on the car ride home from school. The experience had felt exhausting physically and emotionally. It had felt confusing too, and I was honestly scared. I was shaken.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT LEAVE ANY HATEFUL COMMENTS TOWARDS MY MOM \ud83d\udc97, but her response was that I was overreacting and needed to sleep it off. I would feel better in the morning. It was nothing\u2014probably a hot flash. Girls get those. I began to cry. I was confused and wanted to understand what had happened. But I brushed it off and moved on.\n\nIt didn\u2019t happen again until the following summer (the first one had happened in winter\u2014I have not kept track of any dates). That summer, though, it happened a lot. Sometimes I felt as if it was triggered by music (it was triggered twice at the start of playing one song in particular, and then once at the start of playing a different song years later), but I never knew for sure. The music that would have triggered it was newer material, though\u2014nothing that would have even been around when I was a kid.\n\nI continued to brush it off, though there was a definite growing curiosity and yearning to know WHAT exactly it is that I was seeing.\n\nFor a while after that summer, it didn\u2019t happen. I moved in with my boyfriend after high school, and it was happening maybe twice a year at that point. I continued to brush it off, never bothering to worry about it. The flashbacks rarely ever happened anyway, and it wasn\u2019t like it was hurting me.\n\nIt happened for the first time with another person present (one that I felt comfortable talking to, at least) when I got drunk for the first time. I was still drunk, actually. I was sick on my bed, dizzy, sitting up with my head down next to my fianc\u00e9. I felt a flashback \u201ccoming on,\u201d and I announced it to him. I quickly slurred out that he needed to ask me what I\u2019m seeing before slipping into it completely.\n\nHe reported back that during the flashback, I couldn\u2019t really speak. He was talking to me and asking me questions, but I seemed to be completely out of it. I was able to \u201cbarely mutter out,\u201d as he puts it, a couple incoherent phrases.\n\nI was hoping that whatever I had managed to say during my flashback would be insightful, but it only further confused me. I had said random words such as \u201coctopus,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s cold,\u201d \u201corange,\u201d and other words of which I unfortunately and stupidly did not write down at the time.\n\nI continued to brush it off (a theme, if you can\u2019t tell \ud83d\ude02 spoiler alert\u2014this post, which I plan to share to a few different subreddits, is one of the first moves I\u2019ve taken in seriously trying to figure this out). But after that, they grew more and more frequent. I also began smoking weed, so that\u2019s likely related (I don\u2019t know for sure though, as it happens often even in periods where I am not smoking, and it began way before I had even tried pot).\n\nAs probability could predict, after the wedding there were more and more instances of my husband being around to witness, but each time I said nothing of substance.\n\nThe only pattern we have noticed is that I tend to mention things in the vein of \u201ccold,\u201d \u201cwinter,\u201d and \u201cChristmas.\u201d I had also always mentioned a smell. Sometimes I had said I loved the smell, sometimes hated. I always said, however, that the smell was familiar. One time I said it smelled of Christmas. Other than that, it was all a lot of random gibberish, all of which I still have no memory of afterwards.\n\nAt my parents\u2019 house during the holidays one year, I ingested 100mg of THC, thinking it was 5mg. What followed was something that I would compare to a mushroom-like psychedelic experience (I have done mushrooms as well, but nothing related to my flashbacks has ever occurred during those trips\u2014I\u2019ve only done it twice and never will again; no other drug usage, except for prescribed).\n\nAfter realizing that I was blasted out of my mind high, watching the Transformers movie with my parents, I quickly said goodnight and scurried, scared, into my room (the guest room). I immediately dialed my husband for comfort. I was panicking.\n\nGiven that this mindfuck of a high had hit me with no warning and without my permission, I was a bit frantic already at this point.\n\nI had the call on in the background as I got out of bed to turn on the LED strip lights that ran along the ceiling. They flashed bright red, and I felt like I got \u201ctransported\u201d into one of these flashbacks, but it was more real\u2014more intense\u2014than usual.\n\nI felt as if I was actually standing in the room with someone. I couldn\u2019t tell who or where I was. This time, that familiar feeling was missing completely.\n\nIt passed quickly, however, and I proceeded to cry and freak out until the high wore off and I eventually stopped caring about it, per diem. But I remembered it this time. I still remember it, to this day.\n\nLife moved on. Then, a few months later, I had a flashback while standing up and doing my hair. I fell to my knees. My body felt weak. I had never \u201cfallen from weakness\u201d before during these.\n\nAs I began to reflect, though, I realized I had almost always (I wish I could just plainly say always, but I don\u2019t have 100% trust in my own memory lol) had flashbacks either sitting down or nearby enough something or someone that was easy to grab onto.\n\nCombing deeper through my memories, I began to realize that there had actually been multiple instances where I leaned into walls or shoulders for support. During one flashback in particular, slightly drunk at a friend\u2019s wedding, I had nearly passed out on the shoulder of my husband during the groom\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201cDo I always feel so weak during these?\u201d I asked myself, for the first time.\n\nAnother time, a flashback began to hit me as I was walking my grocery cart to my car. I felt it coming, but was able to reach my car. Once I got there, though, I felt an uncontrollable urge to pee. I had enough conscious to know i wanted to avoid pissing myself in the Safeway lot at all costs. I went for a hardly less embarrassing option and squatted on the spot. I sat in the squat there staring off for a bit, I thought I had peed myself for sure. \n\nI had not peed myself, luckily, but I think I came close? I have no idea, really, all I can remember is thinking that i had. \n\nThen, I had a flashback while checking out at the grocery store. The clerk was talking directly to me, and I was staring straight through her, seeing and hearing nothing. I couldn\u2019t manage to keep my cool and ended up regrettably causing somewhat of a scene. I had nearly collapsed.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she had asked me.\n\nI don\u2019t know, I thought.\n\nI already had a regular psychiatrist at this point, and a previous one before that as well. My first psychiatrist, after explaining all of this shit to him, said he didn\u2019t know what it was. He couldn\u2019t call it a flashback because I had no images or references to what I was seeing or experiencing. He said it was incoherent and likely just some type of \u201chot flash\u201d or \u201cfaint spell.\u201d My current psychiatrist, as well as my regular physician, have said the same thing.\n\nI went on with my life and continued to have flashbacks regularly, on and off. I\u2019m 24 now, though, and I want to understand what\u2019s been happening to me.\n\nThis hasn\u2019t happened to me while I\u2019m driving (thank GOD), but I\u2019m scared it will. I can\u2019t stop driving. I have responsibilities. If I had a flashback while driving, though, I don\u2019t know what would happen. I don\u2019t have much confidence that I would be able to keep control of my car, but PLEASE\u2014before anyone jumps to leaving negative comments\u2014I have stopped anyway despite it being highly inconvenient.\n\nShoutout to my amazing husband \ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude09 who, if you couldn\u2019t already tell, is the best.\n\nSo, folks and friends of Reddit, I come to you for answers! I have no idea if this is a trauma issue, a brain issue, a medical thing, or what. Or, if I am indeed overreacting!! I am open to that.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions in the comments\u2014I\u2019m more than open to answering them.\n\nIf you took the time to read this, thank you, you wonderful human! \ud83d\ude42\ud83e\ude77\ud83d\ude38"

I haven't been diagnosed with PTSD from it yet, but I'm fairly certain I will be. I already have trauma in my past, and have been diagnosed with PTSD before. The symptoms I feel as a result from walking on eggshells and being terrified of his moods/emotions are definitely PTSD symptoms. After he woke me up in the middle of the night literally screaming at me because I didn't clean enough, I would often wake with a startle/jump and in panic mode. That happened a few years ago, but I still often wake up startled when I'm with him. I am hypervigilent about his moods.\n\nWhen he seems stressed, sad, anxious, or angry, my heart rate increases. I get heart palpitations. I have migraines, body pains, dissociation, brain fog, and so many symptoms after our fights. He once abandoned me in the middle of nowhere without my wallet/purse, and now I get anxious about being abandoned in strange places. He once put a knife to his throat and threatened to slit it in front of me, and now I have flashbacks to that moment whenever I see a knife. When he's angry, I keep a mental note of all the weapons in the house. I locate the keys and plot my escape route to run out the front door. The hurtful words he's said randomly pop into my head at inopportune times while I'm trying to relax: bitch, cunt, whore, disgusting, psycho, etc. The way his eyes become dark, empty, and full of rage scares the shit out of me and invade my mind. Loud noises startle me after all the times he's thrown stuff around at walls and the floor.\n\nI'm pretty sure I have PTSD from this relationship."

Well I was that person, and I can tell you with confidence I was less heart broken by fleeing my death then by an abusive partner. Not to say that's not very painful, but at least the people that were trying to kill me didn't tell me how much they loved me.

    "content": "So my friend shared me something that happened to her when she was in 5th grade.\nThis is her pov-\n\n\nI was in 5th grade when this event occurred. I was friends with some boys in my class who sat next to me. They had a strange habit of playfully grabbing each other's balls for fun, similar to how girls playfully hit each other\u2019s butts. One time, while I was at the front near the blackboard doing something I can't remember, I felt someone touch my behind, but it felt like more than that, so I looked back only to find no one there, although I made eye contact with a few boys who were seated. I thought this might have been a mistake, so I brushed it off. The next day, it happened a few more times until I finally figured out who was doing it. He was someone I knew and chatted with but wasn't really friends with. He tried to run away but couldn't, and sadly, I didn't say anything back. I just ignored him. I don't know why I didn't respond. My parents always taught me to not let anyone touch me and to speak up if it happened, but that day, I just couldn't. I went home and felt too uncomfortable to talk to my friends, maybe because I didn't know how to bring it up. How could I start my story? What if I was overthinking it? What if no one believed me since I didn't have any proof? I was 10 years old and didn't know much about situations like this. I felt awful and violated, especially since I knew other boys had seen him do that to me, some of whom were close friends, but they didn\u2019t intervene. Moreover, I didn\u2019t act either. So for about one or two days, I skipped school because I was afraid he would do it again, and I wouldn\u2019t speak up. At home, I tried talking to someone\u2014my brother, dad, or mom\u2014but I never felt safe enough since my dad is very protective of me. I still can't pinpoint why I didn't speak out. There are many reasons for this that I\u2019ll explain later. So I couldn't skip school forever. I returned the next day but didn\u2019t leave my seat even for a moment, and during lunch, I spoke to my close friends, all girls. They laughed at first and made fun of me. I even asked if I was the only one or if they had experienced something similar, but no one said a word. The girls felt uncomfortable discussing this, but later agreed to support me after a group of boys tried to push one of the guys onto a girl in our group, likely intending to touch her. We decided that we would keep an eye on their actions and support each other if they touched us. I felt empowered. In the next period, I acted as the monitor, observing everyone. I noticed a girl leaning over a bench, and the same boy who had squeezed my behind approached her to try to touch her but didn't. Worse, he was showing another guy how to do it. When the guy hesitated, he demonstrated what to do. That was when he made eye contact with me, and I rushed over to him and slapped him twice, as well as the other guy who was about to act and didn\u2019t..\nI'm not lying, but I think many people knew about this, and no one\u2014literally no one\u2014tried to stop him. They never agreed, but I don't think my opinion was wrong. He was trying to deny it when I slapped him, asking why I was raising my hands and abusing my monitor Power onto him. I couldn't say anything because of his confidence. Everybody watched, but nobody supported me. I took one of my friend's hands and went to the staff room. I cried and felt awful and weak because I couldn't confess. In the end, I couldn't say anything, and my friend had to explain everything to my headmistress. She was angry and took those two boys to the staff room. The rest, I don't know; school was over, and everyone went home. I still didn't say anything to my parents. There could be three reasons: 1. I felt maybe I would be blamed by them somehow, like why I talked to him, why did I sit in the row beside the boys' row, etc., and they are the last people I want to hear from. 2. I thought my parents wouldn't blame me but would become controlling of my actions. 3. My father has a habit of repeating incidents from my life that ended up affecting me negatively, reminding me of what I shouldn't do again. I was worried they might keep reminding me of this incident to tell me how I should stay away from men. The next day, I went to school and heard how he was slapped by every single teacher in the staff room and that his parents were called. He claimed he did this to 20 girls in class, which was surprising since nobody came to talk to me about it, even when I tried. The second guy pleaded his innocence and said I misjudged him. I asked other guys why they didn't do anything, and they acted like they didn't know. I thought I was okay at that time, but as the years passed, I didn't really recall that incident. However, when I learned about rape, abuse, and molestation, I started feeling those emotions sometimes, but not always. The first guy I dated\u2014 I couldn't open up to him about this. I only hugged him; it felt nice, but I'm always afraid of intimacy. I'm scared of what I will feel if I let a guy get close and touch me in any way. I never got close to anyone to share this story with. It's strange how guys feel awkward when discussing these topics. I understand they don't know how this feels, but I want any reaction, just not silence. Anyway, I moved houses, and when I was in 9th grade, the guy DM'd me, apologizing for that incident. I don't clearly remember what he said, but he was apologizing after 5 years. He said he was just a child and immature. He didn't realize how his actions could have affected me. I cried but didn't tell him. I said it was okay and that I was fine. I didn't talk much about this topic as I was avoiding it. Honestly, I don't know if I should say I forgive him. I probably do, because he might genuinely feel terrible about what he did, but I still feel strange. I'm 19, and I'm still scared of any form of intimacy, whether emotional or physical. I only appreciate that he feels bad about his actions. I can't imagine how I would feel if he didn't. I think he may have acted that way because he didn't understand the difference between guys and girls and that we can't behave the same way with our genders. I remember that incident often, and it hurts deeply. I cry because I never truly expressed my anger towards him or the other guys. I feel anger towards the guys who didn't stand up, the girls who laughed, the girls who didn't admit they were touched too, and my parents who never created a connection strong enough for me to confess this. I cry about this incident every time I remember, and I'm exhausted. I don't think this is trauma; girls go through worse things like rape and abuse by loved ones, which I did not experience. That guy didn't intend to assault me; he was young. I remind myself of this every day, but it doesn't help. Whenever I see my parents fighting or in a bad atmosphere, I get reminded of this incident, even though these are different situations. I watch abuse-related content and hurt myself and cry because I empathize a lot, even though I didn't go through something as severe. I read stories about women who experience these kinds of things. Sometimes, it feels like I'm not really trying to forget but to remember, but why? I should forget and move on. Why am I torturing myself? What should I do?.\n\nAlso therapy is out of question ig.\n"

I have been floating through life since the incident, have major memory issues and a detachment to everyday life. I used to enjoy sex before the second incident, (this took time after the first incident) and I\u2019d like to get back to this. Every time I try to masturbate I picture said family member and get a slight wave of ptsd of the incident. Same happens during sex with others. I\u2019m ashamed of it. \n\nI met somebody I really liked and it took me a while to explain that the reason I wasn\u2019t feeling anything during sex was not because of her but because of this trauma. This ended as there was a time limit on us but it made me realise I want to be able to feel this connection again. I just want to go back to how I was before, and be able to build these connections with people again and enjoy masturbation and sexual experiences, but the thoughts seem to be getting worse.\n\nAny advice on how to overcome this? Have thought about therapy in the past but I don\u2019t think I cared enough about myself enough to put that into action. I now live very remote with no in person therapy options, so if anyone has tried online therapy - is this helpful? Or any non-therapy advice?

We exhanged numbers got to going out for a coffee date. \n\nNow here is where i start being stupid. I offer to drive him back to his flat because it was cold/raining and a number of miles away and im a people pleaser or was then at least. He asks me in for coffee i thought okay.

Basically the spolier tag is SA/possible rape \n\n >!so he then locks his door with me inside with him, so i feel trapped and he is bigger than me, taller and broader than me. I just go with it because what else can i do, i don't remember all the next details really i know clothes are off he is trying to penetrate and can't get all the way due to above condition which is painful obviously, i just lay there really and not say anything else (which maybe i should have but i probably froze honestly) he gives up at some point and seems angry, i try to explain the condition and he just ignores me and unlocks the door so i go home!< \n\nI don't tell anyone until about 2 years ago when my PTSD symptoms become more obvious to me and i have to get my mental health team involved etc. Even now i've only told a few friends and my therapist who say this is SA/Rape and i just don't really see it because he didn't get all the way \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f this why i feel like it wasn't as bad even though i was in pain. \n\nI have been working on this with my therapist a few months ago and i was doing well but something that happenes at work thats triggered it, i have therapy again this thursday so will be discussing this with her. \n\nI just feel like i'm stupid, making it up, making it out to be worse, like im lying. \n\nHe's now in a different country so i don't have his info any longer so can't report him to anyone and i feel bad that i should have reported him.

So, in 2017 my mom was cheating on my dad and he found out I know my dad has anger issues also he has a toxic masculinity mindset but he found out and he woke me up to tell me what happen cause he will use me to see if my mom is texting other guys and go through her phone also I was 9 at the time I told him everything cause I was scared that he would do something and he said he would not beat me well he lied he went upstairs and beat my mom out of her sleep with the belt then he came in my sister's room grab her by her hair and told me to get up and after he let go of my sister hair and came and he yell out my face I was confused and scared cause he said he would not beat but he did this night lasted for hours I fell asleep I don't know how but I did and I woke up and it was still happen but it did cool down until I woke up and he started beating us again he would call my sister a bitch and called me a f slur I thought this was never going to end until me and my sister called the police they came fast went upstairs and they arrested my dad he went to jail for a day I wish it was longer. Fast forward I'm 16 now and of course that trauma that I went through when I was 9 is affecting me alot now my mom went back to my dad yes she went back after all that I love my mom more than my dad but I hated her for doing and me and my dad's relationship is bad we keep arguing with yelling at me and when he yells at mad I start feeling things really strong like I get really mad like I just want to yell at him back also when I get mad when he yells at me I walk back and forth and then I start crying not in front of him and I talk to my self saying how much I hate him tell him to go fuck himself but not to him only to myself then every time something happens between me and my dad I always tell my friends im going to run away I need to go to house then after a few hours or the next day I realize then that was a dumb idea but I keep saying it after something happens between me and my dad also the abuse of dad has been happen before 2017 he would slap my mom and hit us my mom and dad will argue alot. Ok so now you know the story its time to tell why I think I have mild PTSD or showing early signs of it so the first thing I said about after my dad would yell at me I would get really mad and start crying also when they argue like when its just yelling and im in the room with them some times I would just wish the earth would swallow me I dont know if that is a symptom of PTSD but when it gets physical and just really bad I start crying and putting my hands in my ears and I dont have night mares but I get mild flashbacks like its not all the time but in my mind I always think about that day in 2017 thinking if I could do something different I will talk to myself about that day and I do get intrusive thoughts that would make you think I have OCD but I experience the intrusive thoughts alot more and I will think about what if it happens again and its worse the 2nd time and I do avoid my dad sometimes not all the time but thats it for right now I think I dont know if any of these are symptoms of PTSD or early signs of it but I do know that there is something wrong with me and my mental health I had a fucked up childhood and a 9 year old should have not experience that I got my childhood robbed from my dad and my mom but if you do have PTSD can you pls tell me if Im showing early signs of PTSD or its just mild or I dont have it at all im scared and confused and im also scared of getting PTSD I just need help. Sorry if this was long and dark also my dad won't let me see a therapist or psychiatrist he thinks if I just pray all my mental problems will go away and it don't it just gets worse so I don't really know what to do it will just get worse and worse until my mental problems are not mild but again sorry if this is long Thank you for reading this and I hope everyone have a good day."

The feeling of my body slamming against the airbags, the force I was hit with that caused my car to spin out, and the awful smell of rubber and car parts just won't leave me. \n\nI'm trying really hard to remain positive and pull myself together, because everybody keeps telling me I'm lucky that I made it out without a scratch.

I tried tapering a long time ago and I tapered in 5 months and had withdrawls for 7-9 months can\u2019t remember. I would feel like people were watching me , like people were out to get me , like people were looking through my windows and watching me , I would not go for a ride in the car. I was originally diagnosed social anxiety and major depressive disorder at 17. Then at 18 made the worst mistake and took klonopin. Started at .5mg twice a day. Then .5mg 3 times a day. Then 4 a day around 22. At 24 about 1mg a day 3 times so 3 mg. Been on Paxil 40 mg which helped but caused major gi tract issues and sexual dysfunction. I am scared of my future. I am about to turn 28 this April. I got off of the Paxil and lowered the seroquel because I felt like a zombie and got tired of the side effects. I\u2019m not sure what to do at this point.  Everything scares me now and panics me. At 21 I was diagnosed schizoaffective. I have delusions and paranoia mainly from PTSD but it\u2019s gotten worse over the years. I lost a relationship of years and I know eventually I am going to need to taper. I don\u2019t know how to. I don\u2019t wanna loose my job. I don\u2019t wanna loose years of my life.

I\u2019m scared that I\u2019ll develop long term pssd if I get back on the Paxil.

I\u2019m scared of my future. I am a smart good looking guy and I feel like my life is over. 27 year old male. How would I find the right doctor to taper. What is the right taper and would you guys reccomend taking other meds to stabilize me while going through the taper. I\u2019m just at an end point.

I'm here to talk about how my partner at the time reacted. \nWhen we were still fresh in our relationship he said he would not intentionally put himself in harms way for me (Example, if we got mugged it's not worth getting into a physical altercation) he would much rather talk his way through the situation. At the time of the SA we were supposed to meet up in the cafeteria, he was already there but he didn't see it occur, he was watching his phone. I came up to him just broken down and bawling and I could barely get my words out. He said he would try to talk to the other student and I asked him not to and he said \"well im not going to beat the guy up so what do you want me to do?\". \n\nI have to stop there because I don't want to disclose anymore specifics about the incident. \nI will say at the time since we agreed on that subject already, we've also left the school since then.\nNow fast forward to a few weeks ago and then again a few days ago. \n\nA few weeks ago we were in line to check out at a grocery store, he noticed a fishy guy staring at my backside. My partner grabbed me and pulled me in front of him to block the creeps view. Which I thought was fine and kinda sweet. NOW a few days ago, I landed an instant interview with a fast food place. I got excited and said \"hey I just got an interview!\" I showed him the confirmation text and he jumped up wondering if it's real, saying things like \"well I don't wanna find out you got lured there, then I'll hunt down whoevers involved\" he was genuinely concerned and became more protective which again I thought that was nice but.. I just realized he never acted that protective in our school, he was never that involved or actively trying to do something. A month before we left our school I had to quit my part time job because a customer put his hands on me. My partners reaction was almost infantalizing like telling a kid \"Oh sorry you lost your ball, it happens\" \nI just can't believe I'm only just now realizing the change.

But over the years I\u2019ve become introverted and I was still kind but the last year I don\u2019t even have that anymore.\n\nMy whole life I\u2019ve been abused and raped and bullied I\u2019m 17 now but it started to get bad when I was 8 years old. So really more than half of my life I\u2019ve been hurt. And I never understood why. I didn\u2019t deserve it. I\u2019m in the UK so I started college at 16 but wasn\u2019t allowed to go straight to the course I wanted because I went to a special needs school since I was 13 and they thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. So I did a one year foundation course then this year I started my main course. And it was awful. \n\nMost of my year group were awful. There was this girl who accused an older student of being a rapist. And to further push the narrative he was a creep she told people that I had sex with him. Knowing he was a rapist. To make him seem like a creep since I\u2019m way younger than him. And make me seem like I don\u2019t care about rapist. \n\nAnd the whole class turned against us even though I wasn\u2019t even close to him and definitely didn\u2019t have sex with him or even really speak to him. She and a group of her friends would get really mad if people spoke to me. They would give me the silent treatment and if other people wouldn\u2019t give me the silent treatment they would turn people against them too for supporting a person who \u201csupports rapists\u201d. They also said that I sent this guy nudes and that he was sharing the pictures of me online. Which is obviously not true either.\n\nBut everyone hated me. And even in group activities would ignore me and talk infront of me or walk away from me so that I\u2019d not know what to do and look like an idiot. \n\nSo I ended up leaving college. Because of that and I ended up in hospital because of a chronic illness and when I came back they wouldn\u2019t tell me what to do in the group project. So not only was it physically difficult to go in but they was making it almost impossible for me to get any work done.\n\nAfter I left my friends told me that the girl who accused the guy of rape had \u201cforgiven\u201d him. And became his friend. \n\nI lost it. I needed to ruin them. I used an old phone to spam call them and used a text to speech thing when they\u2019d pick up telling them awful things and threatening them. It was big news and my friends not knowing it was me told me the college called the police and so did the girl but the police said it was no big deal. This made me take it further and keep doing it. And I made fake social media accounts saying awful things to them. \n\nI know I\u2019m just as bad as them and my friends keep telling me how scared they are but I don\u2019t care as much as I should. I hate that my whole life everyone\u2019s treated me awfully and I never got the chance to defend myself. I\u2019m a suicidal drug addict for fuck sake. It shouldn\u2019t have gotten to this point. I don\u2019t get why my whole life has been like this. I just wanted to be the powerful one for once. But now I\u2019m just as much of a monster as them. And it\u2019s been ages and I\u2019m still doing it. \n\nThey\u2019ve given up trying to stop it. Because no one will help them. They feel powerless just like I did. And people are turning against them because they think they are attention seeking. The main rapist accuser actually left the college. \n\nI really am such an awful person. Maybe I feel a bit of guilt Ive definitely taken it too far. But it\u2019s just I\u2019m so angry my whole life I\u2019ve been treated like dirt. I want to die. I\u2019ve given myself more reason too. I\u2019m just as bad as everyone else."

I know what love is, I have always experienced it, but it's now just a memory, I can't experience it anymore.\n\nI realised all this just the past year, is it because my mother died? Do I have any form of PTSD? I don't really know, and I really want to know how this can happen. Please if there is anyone who can relate, or someone with knowledge, I only want to know the reason and if I have any form of PTSD, I don't need help."

I feel like a complete failure. Because of all this abuse I\u2019m failing school because I lost all my motivation for it and I just can\u2019t focus knowing the abuse won\u2019t stop. I really feel like I\u2019m the problem. My grandmother constantly antagonizes and disrespects me and talks shit to me about my mom constantly to the point where I told her because I barely even speak to her. I made shit even more worse because my mom cursed my grandmother out. I\u2019m just tired of all the abuse and have little support. I\u2019m tired of being hit and attacked in the house by  my aunt because of small things and I can\u2019t even do shit about it. All this shit happened yesterday. I came back home from not wanting to be in the house with my grandmother she won\u2019t even let me turn off the light to go to sleep. She\u2019s trying to make my life miserable than it already is. Then my aunt and her got into it and she made my aunt leave the house crying and she went crazy at me because I closed the door not trying to get into it and she took the small mirror in my room off the wall and just pressing me trying to hit me with it just going crazy saying she don\u2019t give a fuck about us anymore.

My dad passed 8 years ago and ever since hate snow.. I never saw his that day until was too late, but then again I'm sure my family members  watch him pass was worse. He was shoveling which induced a heart attack.  I was told the type of heart attack he had was \" ticking time bomb\". We sinced have moved to a new house ,but i now hate snow . My mom sometimes shovels and doesn't tell me ,but that is not always the case. I know she doesn't mean to do in a malicious intent. Anyways , it snowed a lot and I I heard her shoveling in my room. I looked out the windows and knew she was okay . I ran downstairs with tears in my eyes and made sure she had her phone with her. She is overweight and I got nervous . I offered to shovel and to tell me when she going out again. She didn't later in the day ,but i could hear her and see her from my room so I went back to bed once I felt she was okay and she had a neighbor shovel next to her and my windows was cracked in the slightly before I slept.  I feel bad I cried and made her upset. It crazy because my dad always made us shovel ,but didn't that year because it was all ice. I know he would of died regardless of the shoveling ,but yeah.  It hard because he wasn't really the dad i always wanted until after high school until I was 21.  Then it was poof just taken aback . Apartently his grandparents died of heart attacks and idk if he even knew that . It is sad because the night before I had feeling compelled to tell him something, but my mom told me not to. My mom did a psychic  reading 2 months before and said the marriage would end. My dad never believed in the spiritual stuff so I also didn't think it be worthwhile.  Plus he was so happy and excited that night with his friends and telling me about the movie he saw. I didn't want to end it on a bad note. He was rarely in that mood and the morning he passed I did hear his voice in the hallways but I was in and out of sleep. He opened my door to let the cat in and when I woke up again he was gone.\n\nI think this happened last year too in regards to freaking out with my mom and tbh im not ready to have another parent pass away .. Im grateful I can vent on here. Also I'm not looking for any sympathy about my dad. I got through today!F29"

    "title": "How or if I should I reach out to partner who I love who ends things over what I think is a trauma response?",
    "content": "I am not told of a PTSD diagnosis but there is definitely trauma in the past.\n\nI was told by my partner that they had been for a few years in the past on the receiving end of abusive behaviour including an ex trying to strangle, being on their guard, and the ex being sectioned.  The ex refused to move out and for a number of years they continued to pay all the bills and lived in the same house as non-romantic but instead as a 'carer' and then as a 'friend'.  I could never get my head around why they stayed for years afterwards?  Any insights?\n\nI'm aware they they receive counselling for the past couple of years, and takes and take a low dose SSRI for anxiety.  I'm not privy to what actually went on in counselling.\n\nMy partner and I over a year of dating had such loving and happy times, for 99% of the time, and were planning a future.\n\nHowever, my partner claimed they wanted a 'drama free' existence and avoided any situations that might be perceived as stressful however minor the conflict.  This was frustrating as sometimes they would cut short my reasonable conversation where they seemed disinterested or perhaps perceiving a potential conflict.  Or make a controversial statement and refuse to justify and stonewall and shut down.\n\nI have anxiety myself.  Perhaps once a month these incidents escalated where I lost patience and challenged this behaviour and there was always a strong sensititivity to a raised voice in particular and where I continued to press my point.  It seems they were overwhelmed.  A distressing argument ensued.  We agreed that if this continued we would seek counselling as everything else was so beautiful.\n\nI am desperately sad and sincerely sorry to say that before that happened on the last incident I shouted at them.  I'm told close up but not sure I was that close.  Even though I apologsed profusely soon after, the next morning they left suddenly and unexpectedly, stopped communicating until ending things after a couple of days, then not collecting valuable things or accepting calls.  I got essentially one chat for half an hour where I was told I was abusive and this would not be tolerated.   I did push for a resolution over the following days but this proved counterproductive.\n\nAll the beautiful parts our relationship were briefly acknowledged but quickly 'blocked out' and refused to be discussed.  The total blame is put on me.\n\nThe personality changed overnight and there was a numbness (that I think is known as disassociation) that was hard to cope with as we were so chatty and tactile normally, they heartbreakingly flinched when I tried to gently touch an elbow, a hostility as if protecting oneself when I only ever loved them.  I vowed the 'shouting at' would never happen again and that it was a one off and offered to get help to be certainI would not.\n\nAll my friends say the reaction to end things so brutally was wholly disproportinate for someone who appeared to be so in love with me when they saw us together not long before.  I was asked to send on their remaining things which I did.  I'm told in that letter, that they 'wish all the best for me',  but they 'must put their mental health first' and that they do not want to see me again.\n\nI do need to make contact over something they is aware is necessary and would accept.  I have waited a number of weeks before doing so in the hope they will be amenable to me reaching out to try to make peace and heal in a way they were not before.\n\nPlease be kind for any ignorance I show.  I did my best but was human and made a mistake, was immedately sorry I did not consider their past trauma in the moment, but seek to understand what happened, and why, and don't want to cause any more distress to them but for me they is throwing away what was for the most part such a beautiful loving relationship.  It's heartbreaking.\n\nI accept the prospects seem poor of reconcilation but I love them and would do anything to help them and I heal.  Is there hope if I use a careful approach when reaching out?"

I have dissociative features with the PTSD too (my doc says even though I am diagnosed DPDR, it actually is PTSD causing the dissociation and DPDR is the label given to people who have no traumatic explanation or association with the symptoms). There recently was a trigger that made my PTSD flare up and thus I decided to seek medical and therapeutic treatment for it.\n\nOn the medicine side, apart from Lexapro (which helped a little), the other drug I tried was Lamictal. I have heard Lamictal helped a LOT of people with reducing PTSD symptoms and even lowering dissociation. However\u2026for me it seemed like Lamictal did 100% the exact opposite. My flashbacks became WAY more frequent. I would get lost in my flashbacks and be nearly psychotic as I would just keep repeating saying the things I said during the actual trauma. I would cry for hours and be dissociated for days before and after the flashbacks. In fact the whole time I was on lamictal, and 2 months afterwards, I seemed to have terrible dissociation. My long term memory and short term memory were hazy as hell and a lot of my trauma related symptoms flared up too (validation seeking, avoidance of triggers). Mood was also unstable as hell and very sensitive to external stimuli. My brain seemed completely destroyed - i was a very mathematical and engineering oriented person but on lamictal i couldn\u2019t do basic thinking. \n\nIt just seems so strange to me given so many people vouch for it. Anyone else experience negative experience on lamictal?\n\nFor what its worth\u2026i also have ADHD\u2026i mean i am diagnosed ADHD but it could be just a manifestation of complex trauma. ADHD med finally kicked my brain back to what i think it used to be before the lamictal. "

A fun bit of abuse.\n\n4 years ago me and my mother lived seperately from my father after she thought it was unsafe, 3 years ago she decided we needed to move back in with him. I did not want to, I already had PTSD from childhood abuse and it seemed like a total non-option at the time. My mother (in all her wisdom) when I was having a panic attack over moving in decided to cut herself so she could come in and show me while yelling at me that it was all my fault she hurt herself for not wanting to move back in with him. (I've recently come to realise that this is the first time I know of her cutting herself. She is usually quite open about her struggles depression, and has not mentioned doing it before, neither does she have any scars. Which is not helping. I dont know if it was genuine or if she was purposefully trying to manipulate me.)\n\nSince that event I've become terrified of worrying or upsetting my mother, avoiding doing or saying anything that could upset her. Whenever I've tried to talk to anyone about it I've ended up sobbing before I can finish the extremely non-discript and normal sentence, \"I dont want to worry her\". Just thinking about telling her something that might upset her has me rattled. So its got me BAD\n\nAnyway, this year I have failed a college course. Before the second term of college. My health and social care course has a discriminatory policy that was not advertised, and if you fail one unit you fail the entire course. This policy has prevented me from completeing two units and theres nothing my school can do about because the policy comes from the board yada yada whatever . I failed through no fault of my own and have since stopped attending because why would I, a fail is a fail and I dont feel comfortable continuing under a discrimatory board. I need to tell my mother this. I have an exam real soon and she's going to get suspicious when I dont give her results at the end of the year. I need to tell her basically right away, and I've waited so long my tutor is offering to email her instead. \n\nSo you can probably tell thats the one thing I really do not want to do right now. Even though me failing was so out of my hands I cannot bring myself to tell her. Recently she has expressed being extremely depressed. So I extra don't want to tell her. I could ask my tutor but he really wants to know why im so worried  and I really dont want a phone call home. What am I meant to do here??? Every option, telling her, having my tutor tell, lying and have her find out in 6 months anyway, all seem really really bad. Really bad. I super dont know what to do and its affecting my other classes and general mental health."

    "title": "Tips for young children with ptsd please",
    "content": "Hello, this is my first Reddit post so forgive me if this is in the wrong group and if this is way too long. My son is 5 years old and in kindergarten. He broke his arm running at PE at the end of October. I believe he was in shock and he is a shy kid, and he didn\u2019t mention his arm hurting as bad as it was and he sat there for at least 2 hours before the teacher noticed the swelling and called me. I immediately raced to the school to get him and all the color was gone from his face. I knew it wasn\u2019t a normal fall. We went straight to the hospital where the X-ray showed what I was afraid of. He had a nasty fracture in his elbow. The Dr. starts saying he needs emergency surgery. There are a lot of things that happened at this first hospital, the nurse couldn\u2019t get the IV, there\u2019s blood all over his arm, it is sending my son into total distress. This is a small farm town with a little bitty backwoods hospital. I start having a gut feeling to leave but everything is happening so fast and my husband is leaning towards staying at the little hospital once the orthopedic surgeon tells him its a super common fracture and he can operate first thing in the morning. We decide to stay for the time being, my son just wants to rest in bed and I lay with him all night. He also has asthma and I am increasingly worrying how that will affect surgery because it seems to be flairing up. Morning comes and his second IV literally falls out of his arm and he now needs a 3rd IV. More distress. My amazing parents come and at this point I am a wreck and I am done with the hospital and ask my mom how to get out of here. She sets out to get us transferred. The nurses are acting so weird and saying \u201cdon\u2019t tell anyone we told you how to request a transfer\u201d it was so strange and I wanted to get the hell out of there asap. The transfer is approved to a great women and children\u2019s hospital. We have a 2 hour ambulance ride. It is now probably 24 hours after the break. We get to the new hospital and immediately they start prepping him for surgery stating that while his fracture was common, the way his bone fractured was actually really rare. My son goes into surgery, it goes perfectly. The team at this hospital are angels, truly amazing people. He gets 3 pins in his elbow and a small incision to ensure the nerve doesn\u2019t get damaged. He gets a soft cast to allow swelling and we spend the night resting and getting asthma treatment. We leave the next day about 48 hours after the break. I am going to try and wrap this up. He missed a week of school, we got his hard cast on, he returns to school. He is definitely reserved and a little nervous but he does fine at school. He was not allowed to play at PE under Dr orders, so he sat out with the teacher. Fast forward to the cast removal. He gets his cast cut off and X-rays. His arm looks great! Now it\u2019s time to remove the pins though. I hold him tightly as the nurses quite literally tug 3 pins out of his bone. He is in absolute distress but it\u2019s over, we made it and his cast is off. I think this is finally the beginning of the end of all this. But it\u2019s like a switch flipped. He withdrew, he started panicking about returning to school. He is saying over and over that he can\u2019t leave me and he cant go back to PE. He is genuinely terrified and anxious. At school the teacher calls me and explains he can\u2019t stop crying. She asks if she can get the school counselor involved and I say absolutely. I also call an outside children\u2019s counselor and get him an appointment the next day. He cries and clings to me every morning but he is opening up to the school counselor and sitting with her at lunch and PE. He is still teary and is having trouble focusing in school on his tasks. Each day is pretty rough but it seems to get just a little better each day. School lets out for Christmas. He has a great time off, but is worrying about leaving me and returning to school. Over the break during the counseling he is diagnosed with separation anxiety and ptsd. A little background, I am a stay at home mom and PreK last year was his first time ever really being away from me and he struggled with that but ultimately had a good time at school and had no problem making it through the day. Anyway, today is the first day back at school and last night was super rough. He cried himself to sleep in my arms while I told him these feelings are okay and they won\u2019t last forever. This morning was rough. My husband does drop off and I do pickup. I could barely get him in the car seat. His teacher has been so amazing and communicative and willing to help any way she can. Counseling is still in the very early stage and while we have received a diagnoses, we haven\u2019t started actually figuring out what to do. So I am sitting here writing this asking for any advice or help or tips from anyone who has possibly been through this with their children. The beginning of this year was so great for him. He loved his teacher, he had friends, he was excited about school, and now he is a totally different kid with a totally different experience. It\u2019s heartbreaking. Of course I wish I could just keep him with me all the time and protect him. I just want to get back to a place where he feels safe at school again and secure being away from me temporarily. Any advice will be greatly appreciated, thanks so much for taking the time to read this. \n\n  \n"

I know space is the only way I'm gonna be free from hearing her voice in my head talking about me in such gross ways, making me feel so disgusting. but I don't see a way to get away from her. our lines are so blurred idk where she starts and I end."

Intrusive thoughts really, really decrease. Even my dissociation is better. It also does wonders for anxiety. Doctors will tell you things like humming or breathing exercises that stimulate the Vagus nerve, and those are great. But you can also buy a device on Amazon for $150 that you put clips on your ear and it does electrical (not painful) stimulation of the Vagus nerver. It works so well and so fast. They say two weeks but I haven't quite hit the 2 week mark yet and I'm seeing dramatic effects already. I'll post a link to the device I use if anybody wants me to, but if I include it in the post the bot will think I'm selling something. I just want people to know there is big help for PTSD."

    "title": "I am just now coming to terms with my PTSD",
    "content": "I was diagnosed with PTSD around 11 years ago (I\u2019m 26 now). I was confused by the diagnosis because I thought I hadn\u2019t experienced trauma. I found out I was diagnosed with it when I was admitted to the psych ward after a suicide attempt when I was 15. I was confused. \n\nI\u2019ve been in therapy fairly regularly since then. It dawned on me slowly. My dad currently has acute myeloid leukemia, but before that he had polycythemia vera. He was diagnosed when I was 3 when he started bleeding internally. He got a chunk of his GI tract and his spleen removed. When I was 8, he had another catastrophic internal bleed. Hospitalized for months, more surgeries. \n\nWhen I was 11, my mom\u2019s mom came to live with us since her dementia had gotten to a point where she couldn\u2019t live independently. I also have a sister who\u2019s 3 years older than me who is autistic, has severe epilepsy, is nonverbal, and requires round-the-clock care. Shortly after my mom\u2019s mom moved in with us, my dad had another catastrophic internal bleed. I remember him showing up in my bedroom doorway looking white as a sheet and saying he had to go to the hospital. I didn\u2019t see him again for three months. In the meantime, our house was hell. Once I went upstairs while my mom was taking a shower to get a book, and she came out of the shower while I was still upstairs. She grabbed me, pulled me to the top of the stairs, and told me I was a murderer, that I could have let my sister or grandmother die and I was a murderer. She screamed at me so loud that my oldest siblings came and literally shielded me with their bodies and begged her to stop. \n\nI remember my sister screaming so loud that the cops were called on us multiple times. She would scream and bang her head against the wall when she got overwhelmed. When she screamed, I started to cry too, because it was hard to see her in pain, because at the time she was my best friend. My mother would say, don\u2019t you fucking dare cry. I couldn\u2019t stop crying so I would just go hide, and she would say, why are you running away? Why do you hate your sister? \n\nI love my mother, and we have a great relationship now, but she is mentally ill and becomes a different person under severe pressure. Once during that hospitalization of my dad, she served dinner to all us kids and we started eating before she sat down\u2014very normal for our family, she\u2019s stressed to us that she hates the normal etiquette rules and we can always eat if we\u2019re hungry\u2014but this time she screamed and pounded the table and called us ungrateful idiots. My sister started scream-crying. I started crying. I wanted to go to my room and calm down, but our mom screamed at me to stay at the table and eat. It was Mother\u2019s Day. One of my oldest siblings said, \u201cstop being mean to him.\u201d She screamed \u201cNO\u201d in this voice I\u2019ll never forget. Our family dog started to growl and snap at her. I remember everything eventually quieted down and we ate in silence. I was trying to stop crying and not throw up. \n\nMy dad eventually came home. He was very weak and sick for a while. He eventually got his strength back and started working again, and he would have to go on business trips. I remember being 12-13 and begging him to please not leave me alone with my mom. My oldest siblings had gone to college by then. I was so scared. He didn\u2019t know what it was like without him there. I told him how scared I was of her and he just told me to listen to her and be polite.\n\nTo be a better brother, I downloaded a recording of my sister scream-crying to my iPod and listened to it over and over again to desensitize myself. My mom calling my name still scared me. If I didn\u2019t run out of my room and respond quick enough, she\u2019d be furious. To this day, I\u2019m scared to wear headphones or earphones because I\u2019m paranoid. I always have only one ear in. I\u2019ve lived outside of my parents\u2019 house for 8 years. \n\nI attempted suicide at 15. I truly felt my family would be better off without me. Someone my parents were boarding at the time found me and raised the alarm. I remember coming in and out of consciousness on the way to the hospital and my mom screaming why? why? why? She then read all the diaries I\u2019d kept fastidiously since I could write. I remember her coming to the hospital and telling me she\u2019d read all my diaries and my vision just going gray. We\u2019re both writers, and she\u2019d read everything that was precious and personal to me. As an adult now, I understand why she would do it. At 15, I felt like nothing would ever be okay again. I had access to a notebook in the hospital and I wrote \u201cI hate you, I hate you,\u201d etc. over and over again. When I was discharged, she threw that notebook away. It was also full of things I wrote about wanting to live again\u2014poetry about what I\u2019d seen out the window of my room. \n\nMy mom has since apologized for how she treated me when I was a kid. She\u2019s calm and kind and I feel comfortable disclosing things about my life to her. Just tonight we went to Home Depot together and laughed to the point of crying over me carrying a huge bag of rock salt that had a tear in the bottom and me trailing rock salt everywhere I went. We talk candidly about our depression and anxiety. When I recently had a horrible back-to-back series of panic attacks, she was there and talked me through them and sat in the mental hospital waiting room with me for six hours. \n\nI went back to therapy this month after a year and a half without it. I\u2019ve always felt like what I went through shouldn\u2019t be considered trauma. But I have night terrors about it. Both of my exes and my current roommate have complained that I wake up screaming and thrashing, and I do wake up screaming. I did a sleep study once to address my insomnia, and they told me the data was inconclusive because I was awake too much. I punched my ex in my sleep once. Most nights I wake up screaming not remembering why I\u2019m screaming. Day-to-day I often get panic attacks that render my body unusable. I have to hide at work. Sounds that are tonally similar to my sister crying trigger them. I can\u2019t stop them. They\u2019re very physical. I stopped listening to music because tones similar to my sister crying trigger panic attacks.\n\nI went back to therapy recently after a therapy hiatus. I tried to talk as honestly as possible. My therapist and psych said I don\u2019t have generalized anxiety, just PTSD. My \u201ctrauma\u201d feels stupid, even now that I\u2019ve accepted it was trauma. I wish I\u2019d been stronger. I wish I had been a better kid to my parents. I wish I was better. "

After that, I moved in with friends and eventually became estranged from both of my parents a couple of years ago.\n\nAt 26, I finally got my own place, and I\u2019ve worked hard to stay off the grid\u2014changing my number and cutting contact. I\u2019ve found peace being away from my parents and truly don\u2019t want any contact with them. My boyfriend and his family have been amazing and supportive, and I\u2019m grateful to have found a safe environment with them.\n\nHowever, a situation with my best friend has left me feeling betrayed. She knew everything about my trauma, but she \u201cforgot\u201d and gave my aunt my phone number after I specifically told her not to. This led to my aunt and later my mom contacting me, which forced me to change my number yet again.\n\nWhile I initially tried to brush it off, I can\u2019t shake the betrayal. My boyfriend\u2019s mom gave me great advice and said it\u2019s time to end the friendship because I can\u2019t trust her. It\u2019s been hard because I\u2019m sad about ending a friendship I\u2019ve had for so long, but I know I need to protect my peace.\n\nOn top of that, I\u2019m still struggling with the trauma of my past. I keep having nightmares about my parents, and being alone sometimes makes me feel scared or sad. I\u2019ve also been on edge, dealing with low self-esteem and confidence issues. I\u2019ve tried therapy before, but it wasn\u2019t solution-based, and I didn\u2019t find it helpful.\n\nI\u2019ve found a new place for therapy and really hope it works because I\u2019m tired of feeling stuck in this pain. When things get overwhelming, I sometimes turn to wine or weed gummies to escape, but I don\u2019t want that to be my only way to cope. I\u2019m an artist, and painting has been a part of my healing process, but I don\u2019t always feel motivated to create.\n\nMy question is: How do I begin to truly heal from the hurt of my past and the loss of trust in people I cared about? How can I manage the overwhelming feelings without feeling like I\u2019m drowning?\n"

    "content": "Working in project for my kids, future vets, families.  Specifically trying write from framework of the chaos of ptsd without using specific traumas or shaming my partner and those who were part of my journey through the suffering.\n\nLemme know what think or should expand into. Thanks\n\n********\n\n Chapter 1: The Unseen War\n\nThe first thing they don\u2019t tell you about PTSD is how invisible it is. Not just to the outside world, but even to the people closest to you, the ones who love you, depend on you, and look to you for strength. And when you can\u2019t explain it, when even you don\u2019t fully understand what\u2019s happening inside your own head, the silence becomes its own battlefield.\n\nI loved her. God, I loved her. She was my everything andmy best friend, the mother of my children, the guide who kept me anchored when life felt like a storm. But love isn\u2019t always enough. That\u2019s another thing they don\u2019t tell you. PTSD doesn\u2019t care about love. It doesn\u2019t care about the promises you made or the dreams you built together. It creeps into the spaces between you, turning connection into distance, joy into frustration, and safety into something foreign.\n\nI didn\u2019t mean to hurt her. I never wanted to be the thing that broke her spirit. But when you\u2019re fighting a war inside your own head, it\u2019s hard to see how much damage is spilling over onto the people you care about most.\n\nThe Weight of Responsibility\n\nWhen you live with PTSD, the world expects you to carry the weight of your own healing. You\u2019re supposed to explain it\u2014to your spouse, your kids, your friends. You\u2019re supposed to find the words to make them understand why you\u2019re distant, angry, or numb. You\u2019re supposed to reassure them that it\u2019s not their fault while simultaneously trying to figure out how to put yourself back together.\n\nAnd when that explanation doesn\u2019t come\u2014or worse, when it comes out wrong\u2014it\u2019s your family that suffers. She suffered. She tried so hard to love me through it, to hold onto the version of me she fell in love with. But the truth is, that version of me was slipping further away, and I didn\u2019t know how to stop it.\n\nThe Struggle to Make Her Happy\n\nI spent years trying to make her happy. Not just because I wanted to, but because I believed it was my responsibility. I thought if I could just do more, be more, give more, then maybe I could fix what was broken between us. But the harder I tried, the more I felt like I was failing.\n\nPTSD makes everything feel like a fight. Even love. It turns everyday interactions into battles you\u2019re not equipped to win. I wanted to respond to her needs, to her hurt, but most of the time, I was just reacting\u2014reacting to my own pain, my own triggers, my own inability to explain what was going on inside me.\n\nShe deserved better. She deserved the man she married, the one who made her laugh and feel safe. And I wanted to be that man. But PTSD doesn\u2019t just take from you\u2014it takes from the people who love you, too.\n\nHonoring Her\n\nHere\u2019s the hardest part to admit: I wasn\u2019t the only one fighting. She was, too. She fought for me, for our family, for the life we built together. She was strong in ways I didn\u2019t always see at the time. She carried burdens I should have shared with her but couldn\u2019t.\n\nShe\u2019s the mother of my children, and I\u2019ll always honor her for that. She taught them how to love, how to care, how to navigate a world that can be so unkind. She gave them pieces of herself that will always be a part of them.\n\nAnd she was my guide. Even in the moments when we were lost, she showed me what love and resilience look like. She stayed when it would have been easier to leave. She fought for me even when I didn\u2019t know how to fight for myself.\n\nOwning My Part\n\nBut love isn\u2019t about erasing accountability. I have to own my part in what happened. PTSD may have been the villain in our story, but I was the one who let it control me. I was the one who let my reactions dictate my actions, who didn\u2019t have the tools to communicate my needs, my pain, my hope.\n\nI let the weight of my own struggles blind me to hers. And that\u2019s a truth I\u2019ll carry with me for the rest of my life. It\u2019s not self-pity\u2014it\u2019s responsibility. It\u2019s knowing that while PTSD shaped my actions, it didn\u2019t absolve me of the impact those actions had on her and our family.\n\nThe Unspoken Hurts\n\nShe once said something to me that still echoes in my mind: \u201cI just want to understand.\u201d She wasn\u2019t asking me to be perfect. She wasn\u2019t asking me to be someone I wasn\u2019t. She just wanted to know the man she married was still in there somewhere.\n\nBut how do you explain something you don\u2019t fully understand yourself? How do you put into words the way your heart races at nothing, the way your mind replays scenes you\u2019d give anything to forget, the way you feel disconnected from the people you love even when they\u2019re right in front of you?\n\nIt\u2019s not fair. None of it is fair. Not to me, not to her, not to anyone who\u2019s ever had to live with the ripple effects of trauma. But fairness isn\u2019t the point. Healing is. Growth is. Redemption is.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nI\u2019ll never stop loving her. Not in the way we once were, but in the way you love someone who shaped your life and gave you three amazing children. I\u2019ll honor her not by trying to fix the past, but by learning from it\u2014by becoming the man I wanted to be for her, even if it\u2019s too late for us.\n\nThis journey isn\u2019t about erasing the hurt. It\u2019s about transforming it. It\u2019s about taking the lessons, the pain, and the love, and using them to create something better. For me. For my kids. And maybe, one day, for someone else.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, PTSD isn\u2019t the whole story. It\u2019s just one part. The rest of the story is still being written, one step at a time. Always forward. Never alone. \n"

Also, even when I try to masturbate I feel really uncomfortable, kind of guilty in a way or like I\u2019m doing something wrong. I am in a really good relationship with my boyfriend, we are so happy and he is so perfect. The only issue we have is that I don\u2019t like that he watches porn and masturbates. He does it often, multiple times a day and multiple times during the night. We have talked about how I feel and he has been doing it less, but he also lies to me about doing it when I know he is. Sometimes he admits to it and it makes me feel a little better that I know and he is being honest with me, but truthfully I don\u2019t want him doing it at all. I know masturbating is normal but I have a hard time accepting that. It makes me really uncomfortable and makes me feel very anxious. \nA little back story, when I was younger, about age 9-13 my mom dated a guy that used to groom me. I woke up multiple times to him touching me and jerking off. When I told my mom, she said I must have been dreaming. She completely disregarded what he was doing to me, but that\u2019s beside the point. Also, when I was about 14 I had a guy friend stay the night and he did the same thing. He was touching me and jerking off and I just froze and let him finish while he thought I was sleeping. \nI am assuming I am traumatized by these events as I was in my own home and in my own bed and was touched without consent while they were sexual with themselves. \nBut, my question is, how do I get over these feelings of anxiety when someone is masturbating? My boyfriend and I are in love and our sex life is great, but I find myself having a really hard time with the thought of him masturbating. The watching porn bothers me as well, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an insecurity issue or past trauma haunting me. \nWe have had many conversations about this topic and he knows how I feel, but how do I get over these feelings of anxiety about it?

I\u2019m a fellow CSA PTSD fighter and I\u2019m in a relationship where things are progressing sexually and I imagine there\u2019s many valuable pieces of advice y\u2019all have that would be so helpful to me!\n\nMy background leads me to feel fear that someone thinks of me sexually, isn\u2019t able to control themselves/stop and is grooming/convincing me to want to have sex (never being sure what I want)\n\nSo I was hoping to get your thoughts on the below:\n\n\n1. What are some things that have helped you get comfortable getting sexual with a new partner?\n\n2. My therapist is suggesting we do \u201cbehavioral experiment\u201d - have any of you done this? (An example is to make out with my date (1 month long relationship) for a short amount of time and when I say stop, we stop so that I can show myself that I have control, he will listen and I don\u2019t need to be afraid)\n\n3. Is there any other thing you can point to? I haven\u2019t seen too much literature on the practical steps. I imagine it\u2019s because everyone who acknowledges their trauma works with their therapist outside Reddit \ud83d\ude43\n\n4. Have any of you felt weird discussing details of your current sexual experience with your therapist? Like even talking about making out feels weird, don\u2019t ya think?\n\n(Note: I\u2019ve had sex before but was too disassociated to recognize that I was in a lot of emotional pain!)\n\nThanks so much for your advice in advance!"

My mother disclosed that the earliest signs were from when I was 2 years old recently.\nMy whole adult life from 14 I've experienced issues with my mental health and substance use disorder. I've gotten sober since having my children with only a few alcohol binge relapses. I'm now thinking of giving up my job to dedicate 12 months to therapy and develop healthy coping strategies. I still feel like I'm over reacting and being over dramatic but I'm starting to notice patterns throughout my life that connect to the sexual trauma.\nIs it normal for ptsd sufferers from child sexual abuse to try to minimize the impact and events in their own brains?"

    "content": "I'm telling you my experience hoping someone can help me understand what to do: after giving birth to my daughter I suffered from severe anxiety. Various psychiatrists prescribed me SSRI\u2019s that didn't work. I would wake up in the morning with anxiety and go on like that all day. In the evening when I returned home from work it was the worst part: I had many intrusive thoughts that literally scared me to death. I felt huge waves of fear and I couldn't do anything. I couldn't cook or wash my daughter. It was horrible.  I had a lot of paranoia, a lot of anxiety, fear, I thought I was going crazy. The mere word \"crazy\" or \"psycho\" made me scared because I was afraid of becoming one. The worst time as I was saying was around 5pm until just before going to sleep when everything faded away and became livable. All this went on for 4 years until a doctor decided to have me do blood tests which revealed a hormonal imbalance. They prescribed me the pill (bc) and since then things have definitely gotten better. I no longer have anxiety and only when my period comes and during the first pills I feel anxious again. I forgot: at first they gave me a pill that was probably too strong and it sent me into a deep depression for a few days (until I stopped taking the pill and things gradually got better).\n\nI'm finally better but I have several memories of these past four years that often make me worry and don't let me live my life well. In particular when I hear about depression I get very scared because I have really bad memories of the days that I had to go through. Furthermore I never live the afternoon well. Those hours from 5 to 7 pm always scare me a little and I'm not happy. \n\nThere are days when I pay little attention to it and days when everything becomes dark and I cry a lot for what happened and for the fear that it could happen again.\n\nThis is my story, and I would like some advice on what to do. I\u2019m really afraid i might get worse with emdr but i don't want to miss an opportunity to be really well. Or maybe cbt could be enough?\n\nI am currently on 10 mg of paroxetine and the contraceptive pill.\n\nPlease be kind and reassuring. Here is a mother who has suffered so much and who would like to free herself from all this to be able to live better with her daughter and her family.\n\nAlso: I hope my story can be useful to some other mother too \ud83e\ude77"

On every visit I tell my therapist something then she asks how I feel about them emotionally and I don't have an answer. \n\nI can recognize when I'm stressed or really uncomfortable but other than that I literally don't know what emotions I feel. Sometimes I'm overcome with different feelings but trying to figure then out is impossible. \n\nI feel like my therapist is getting impatient with me because of this and she tells me that I need to learn to recognize my emotions, but how do I do that? I know I didn't have much problems with all this when I was a little child but all the years of everything whiped out my old self completely. All the trauma just left my brain blank just the \"survival instincts\". I''m an adult man on the autism spectrum now, it's not like there's too many occasions to talk about emotions on daily basis if I'm sober. \n\nIf I want to recognize my feelings I have to jump through loops to figure them out. Oddly enough I'm great at reading other people's emotions from hints or body language so often I try imagining what somebody else would feel in a situation, then try to logically pinpoint if their emotions could be what I feel. It's weird and my therapist says I'm over thinking everything, but I've got no other way to know what's going on in my brain\n\nI've tried figuring myself out on my own but every time I have to stop and distract myself becausemthe only thing I end up recognizing is fear. I hate all of this, it's confusing and frustrating and I just want to get this over with and get to the next step in therapy"

For a while I thought I was a sex-repulsed asexual, before realising I do indeed experience sexual attraction (which makes me deeply uncomfortable), and that what I am experiencing is sexual repulsion as a consequence of trauma. \n\nI am deeply disgusted by sex. I wouldn't call myself sex positive at all though I would like to be. I wish I could pretend that sex didn't even exist. I can't watch sex scenes in tv shows or movies, porn grosses me out, and I haven't had an intimate relationship since the trauma because I know my partner would most likely want sex. Hearing people talk about sex or their sex lives makes me want to vomit and jump out of my skin. Listening to music can be challenging - I swear 50% of music has a sexual innuendo in it somewhere. I think subconsciously I believe sex = violence, even if it is consensual, and it's hard to make that separation. \n\nI'm about to start therapy specifically for this issue. I would like to hear from others who have been able to overcome this quite extreme level of sex repulsion and what worked for you. Please show me that there is hope."

    "content": "I have been reading on this sub for quite some time now and thought I should share my story, I don\u2019t have an official diagnosis yet from a psychiatrist but I see one in about 15 days. I\u2019m a 28(M)\n\nI have 3 major traumas I experienced in the last 4 years that have made it nearly impossible to work because of panic attacks and constant intrusive thoughts and physical discomfort\n\nTrauma #1:\nI got a call around 7 am from my dad around 4 years ago that my little cousin overdosed on fentanyl and died at 18 years old, my cousin and I had been best friends since he was just a toddler, he was basically the closest person to me out of, best friends doing many things together\n\nTrauma #2:\n3 years ago I was on my way home from work around 1 am when a person ran a red light and hit me in my driver side door, the impact knocked me out and threw me into the passenger seat, i crawled out of my passenger door and the ambulance and police were already there or just pulling up, the entire thing was a blur. I was transported by ambulance to the hospital and had no major injuries. My injuries consisted of heavy bruising, stitches in the side of my head, and a few cuts and scrapes. However I found out recently when requesting medical records that the hospital never checked my head, they gave me an X-ray of my head thats it and I\u2019ve been struggling badly since this accident. This accident is what I have been blaming for my mental issues \n\nTrauma #3:\n2 years ago i was at work, at the same job I had been in the accident driving home from. It was about 2 hours into my shift when I got a call that my sister was in a motorcycle accident and was being taken by lifelite to the hospital from the accident scene, my mental health at this point was already bad from my accident and losing my cousin. My sister was intubated in a coma for a couple of months in the icu with brain damage and other serious injuries. I only went to the hospital to see her twice because I was having severe panic attack issues. Fast forward to now she is in a nursing home in the small town I live in with a traumatic brain injury. She is completely disabled on a feeding tube, the only thing she can do is talk and is in severe pain. I don\u2019t go see her like I should but I still do visit even if it\u2019s only once a month. This led me to ultimately leaving this job because of my mental health and relating working there to the trauma.\n\nTrauma: A 4th thing \u00cd should add is when my cousin overdosed my grandpa blamed me for his death, because at the time I was also experimenting with the same type of drugs, I had quit for a couple months and was trying to help my cousin stop using them. Then he overdosed, and soon after my grandpa put the blame on me, then he got Covid and died, me and my grandpa were always very close but I almost have resentment that he blamed me. It caused a massive blow up in the family with my dad going and having issues with my gpa because of him trying to place the blame on me, as if losing my cousin wasn\u2019t already extremely hard.\n\nBasically \u00cd just wanted to share my story because I know everyone goes through different things in their lives that can be traumatic but I\u2019ve been having a terrible time coping. I am seeing a therapist every other week and go in for intake at an intensive outpatient counseling center next week. I\u2019m physically shaking typing this out it\u2019s pretty crazy. I also have been on lexapro which gave me some relief for awhile until I tried going back into my main field of work and experiencing panic issues again. Right now I doordash for income which is going terrible because I\u2019m having issues leaving my house with panic attacks. Thankfully my parents are helping me as much as they can as I have my own house, girlfriend, and 2 kids to look after.\n\nI am very much considering trying to go on disability so I have some type of income so I can focus solely on my mental health and trying to get better. The stress of bills and trying to make money makes it very difficult to heal myself and try to move past the trauma\n\nMy question to you guys is do you think it is okay to sign up for disability? Are there any medications that have helped you with panic attacks and physical anxiety symptoms with intrusive thoughts and constant ruminating? I\u2019m currently not medicated which is probably making this a lot worse. Just any advice in general could help. Thank you! "

    "content": "Hello everyone, I very recently finally left a very toxic relationship. I was with this person for a few years and should\u2019ve left truthfully after the first few months. Me and this person were kind of on and off give or take every few months for about the first year and a half but once we were on again there wasn\u2019t another off period until the recent official break up. I have 0 intention of ever going back to this person or even talking to them. Initially it felt so freeing to finally be away from this person. It was painful as well as I stayed due to holding onto the good moments in the relationship hoping more of those would come and there would one day be no more bad moments with this person. I had a major wake up call in an argument with this person that made me realize, this person is never changing and I need to get the heck out of here so I did. (I\u2019m sorry for the vague information I\u2019m scared to put too much information). Recently, in the heat of the moment of New Year\u2019s Eve, I slept with a good friend of mine. I thought at first it was a good idea, it was fun I enjoyed it and it was keeping my mind off of the relationship I had left not too long before. Things were fine until immediately after. Like literally, we both got cleaned up and dressed and it hit me. I started to slowly have flashbacks of traumatic moments in the relationship i was in. Most in which i thought i forgot about. One of the biggest thing that keeps circling in my brain is, this recent ex instilled a deep anxiety in me regarding sex and STDs. I want to add, I am clean and have been tested throughout our relationship at my yearly appts. I had not done anything with my ex since about the beginning of 2024. My friend who I slept with is also clean (I\u2019m not putting their sex history online but it had been a minute and they were tested as well, all clean). This ex basically made it seem like if I left and got with anyone else with my body count being (11) I was gonna get STDs because my body is \u201cworn down\u201d. While I like to think I\u2019m smart enough to know this is not at all how this works, my brain is a twisted mess and it\u2019s creating narratives and anxieties over something super unrealistic. I want to add my ex\u2019s body count is well over 20 and he was tested multiple times as well over the course of our relationship and he\u2019s all negative. I was diagnosed with ptsd when I was 17 from previous SA and abuse. Over the years I\u2019ve had multiple other traumatic events that have added bits to my ptsd. And now here I have this multiple year relationship. In long short, I\u2019m terrified my ptsd will make it hard for me to ever get into another relationship again or ever even have a sex life. My ex tore me down with my confidence during intimate moments and now I just feel like a walking blob. Sorry for the rant if you made it this far i appreciate you. If some of this doesn\u2019t make 100% I\u2019m sorry I woke up in the middle of the night from a flashback nightmare and I couldn\u2019t go back to sleep. "

    "title": "Getting ostracised in career because of PTSD",
    "content": "I just need to get this out of my system. Long story short I had trauma since I was around 6 years old, mum turned alcoholic, had behavioural problems through teens, have been very alone most of this process. Around 3 or 4 years ago started heavy-duty therapy to deal with all of this, and around August I finally started processing things that I went through. \n\nI want to be an opera singer. I\u2019ve been studying for around 7 years or so, and I\u2019m very fortunate with the opportunities that have been given, but I knew from early on I would not have an easy ride to this career.\n\nAll throughout my undergrad I had severely low self esteem, and eventually made it so that my teachers told me I could never pursue this career. My voice was also very quiet, and I sounded very shy and, quite frankly, shit. If I were in their shoes I would have said the same to me, cause it did not sound like an amplified voice at all. I took a year break and had a major breakthrough. I had a better teacher during that time who was great, and I felt more confident in my abilities. By that point everyone knew I had mental health problems (I would almost constantly cry when things were bad)and I got quite frustrated with myself. I started therapy around this point, and after a year or so things were looking up.\n\nMy teacher recommended another teacher, and I had a trial lesson. We hit it off right away, but they were quite strong-headed. I wanted them to be my mentor because they said they related to how I felt, they were the same at my age. It was fine for a while, until I didn\u2019t get into a programme I went for. They basically said I couldn\u2019t be my authentic self because people don\u2019t want to be around miserable people. I understand what they mean, but I read it as \u2018my authentic self is wrong and I have to change that\u2019. So I worked really hard for a year and a half to \u2018fix\u2019 the way people perceived me. I hardly cried, or if I did, it wasn\u2019t as big of a deal. I thought I was finally getting somewhere, and I auditioned to the same programme again, and a couple of days beforehand, my teacher told me to say these specific things. I trusted her, but when it came to the interview (which she was on the board so she knew what questions we\u2019re going to be asked) they wanted the exact opposite. I didn\u2019t get in. I now realise, and have been validated by my partner (who\u2019s also a singer) and colleagues of all ages that I was manipulated and kinda emotionally abused by her. Regardless, the people with the most important opinions don\u2019t see it that way.\n\nA trusted person on the board later told me that they didn\u2019t think I was strong enough to have a career in opera, and they didn\u2019t choose me not because of my vocal ability (which I worked so hard on and I feel is definitely fit for the stage), but because they felt I couldn\u2019t handle the stresses of the job. I was heartbroken. I still am.\n\nToday, I got a message from someone that a summer program that I auditioned for and got on the reserved list for (I\u2019ve been twice before, there are 2 people on reserves for each voice type) had a drop out and I was not the first pick of the reserves. I also have not been chosen to participate in an opera company that I\u2019ve been a part of for 10 years, and I just know this is all connected to the fact that my PTSD and my upbringing are the main factor. \n\nI\u2019ve never had a support person, except for my partner who I\u2019ve been with for 8 years. I don\u2019t have money (was cut off completely by parents at around 17). Im just so scared that people will always think I\u2019m too weak, that they won\u2019t listen to what I have to say because of my \u2018problems\u2019. I\u2019m so sad and disappointed and angry. I know I\u2019m so fucking strong, and I know I know I have something to say with my voice. I just need to get out of my country and start fresh, but even so you need references to get in any young artist programme, and I\u2019ve got no one to turn to. I\u2019m so mad that these are the cards I\u2019ve been dealt. I just want to tell my story to others, because I feel so misread and mistaken. I want people to know how many obstacles I have against me, I just want to scream from the rooftops that this isn\u2019t my fault, and I\u2019ve been trying my hardest, and that I\u2019m only human. But I\u2019m so scared to alienate even more than I already have been. I dunno, what do I have to lose?"

Took every ounce of self-control not to lash out at every minor inconvenience and annoyance.  And now I just feel drained.  I feel a little bit better, now that I'm off the plane, but I really want to stop by a liquor store on the way home and spending a frankly irresponsible amount of money on alcohol."

    "content": "I used to be a flight attendant\u2014my absolute dream job. I worked so hard to earn my license and secure a work contract, and when I started flying, I felt truly happy and fulfilled. But soon, things began to fall apart. The environment at my base (the airport where I worked) was incredibly toxic. The people there were rude and unwelcoming, making it difficult to form friendships. At the same time, I was in a relationship with a toxic boyfriend who constantly invaded my privacy due to his jealousy. He insisted on picking me up from work because there was no public transportation nearby, and I had no other choice. Every time I spoke to colleagues, he would interrogate me about who they were. His psychological abuse wore me down. Saying \"no\" to him often led to dramatic, exhausting confrontations, so I avoided it whenever I could. Eventually, I became pregnant. Even then, he continued to scream at and manipulate me. At just six weeks, I suffered a miscarriage. They put me in a hospital with women who were there to give birth, so I was listening them to have cute talks with their husbands about their babies, and I was there in a lake of blood crying.  In the same devastating period, I lost my dream job as well. From there, life only seemed to get harder. I desperately wanted to return to flying, but every airline I applied to rejected me. I attended several open days, where I was given false hope, only to be let down after waiting weeks for a response. During this time, I met someone new. We spent some time together, and he texted me every day at first. But when I told him I was quitting smoking, his response showed his self-centeredness\u2014he immediately turned the conversation back to himself. The dynamic quickly became forced, and after a few days, he left me on read, and that was the end of it. From my past relationship, I\u2019ve also developed an aversion to physical touch\u2014being hugged or kissed makes me uncomfortable. This has made me seem distant and cold to others, even though I don\u2019t want to be. I feel like my life has come to a standstill, like there\u2019s no hope left. Every time I try to pull myself out of this darkness, something pulls me back down.\n\nRecently, I went to Rome on holiday and really liked it there. It gave me a glimmer of hope, so I decided to look for a job in the city. But once again, every place I applied to rejected me. It feels like I can\u2019t catch a break, no matter how hard I try."

    "title": "How to Help a Friend With PTSD ",
    "content": "TW: Very brief mentions of suicide,  sa, abuse, extreme violence, and drug abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI could have just as easily titled this 'Don't Believe These Stereotypes About PTSD' and some of this is veiled venting. I do have ptsd myself, but this would have read weird if I kept switching from third to first person and back.\n\n1. They Are All Different, Just Ask\n\nOne of the first steps to supporting a friend, partner, family member, etc. with ptsd is to ask them what you can do to support them. They are all different, and just going off to do research on your own can lead some people to jump to conclusions and cause misunderstandings and even sometimes hurt feelings. That doesn't mean learning about it from other sources is always a bad idea, but sometimes going directly to the person effected isn't sufficient, for example if someone just started developing ptsd or isn't even aware they have it yet they might not have the knowledge and experience to know what would help them best. They also might focus only on what you can do and leave out the warnings of what not to do. Honestly, that all goes for any condition, mental or otherwise, but someone with ptsd specifically might just say that there's nothing you can do for them due to the feelings of hopeless, confusion, and disconnection ptsd can cause. That isn't true, of course you should encourage them to seek professional help if they haven't already, (though do be gentle about it as some of them have bad experiences and even trauma from therapy) but there are things YOU can do to help someone with ptsd.\n\n2. Their Trauma Their Business\n\nDon't ask them what caused their trauma or assume that if they tell you about an event that might have been traumatic that must have been what caused them to develop ptsd. It's not important for you to know what happened in order to help them and it is private information. Some therapists don't ask traumatized people to share the details of their trauma for a long time because the distress of sharing those details too early can do more harm than good and even a lot of professional help can be done by focusing only on the responses to trauma. Some people have had others minimize their trauma as 'not bad enough' and sometimes it's just a long story or a long series of stories as it's not always 1 event that caused someone's ptsd. It's also possible that they went through one or more events that could be considered traumatic but did not develop ptsd from those experiences as going through something terrible does not mean you have ptsd, in fact of all the people that experience life threatening trauma only 1 out of 3 end up with ptsd, and some people have the symptoms of ptsd for a while (no longer than 6 months) after the traumatic event,  but don't end up developing ptsd.\n\n3. It WAS Bad Enough \n\nIt doesn't matter if you've been through much worse and think you're fine or what they've been through really does seem trivial, if they got ptsd from the experience clearly it was bad enough to them. There are people who have been through SA, life threatening abuse, murder attempts, etc. who still think their reaction is disproportionate and they don't deserve help, this particular feeling must be even deeper in the people who developed ptsd from years of bullying or emotional abuse. Saying someone's overreacting will not help them or change their reaction it will simply tell them you are not a safe person to be around and if it looks like they've 'stopped their whining' what's really happened is they are hiding any trauma and unpleasant feelings from you because in their mind you have let them know you don't care about their feelings anyway. It can even help them to say out loud that what they've been was very bad, it might help them to feel validated and blame themselves less. People with ptsd, especially the ones who were abused, have trouble trusting people and making and maintaining connections already, so an experience like that can be very destructive.\n\n4. They Are Not Just Stupid Now, But Could You \nDumb It Down Sometimes Anyways?\n\nSome lesser talked about symptoms of ptsd are trouble focusing and memory issues. This can lead to worse grades in school, performance at work, paying less attention in conversations and much more. It can also be one explanation for why ptsd tends to cause lack of interest in activities someone used to enjoy because something like watching TV might just be harder for someone to focus on now. People with adhd will probably relate to some of this and there is an overlap in symptoms and someone who was born with adhd's symptoms might be noticeably worse after developing ptsd.  It can be difficult, but please try to be patient if they seem like they aren't paying attention and keep forgetting important things, it's not by choice it's because they have to learn new ways of navigating the world and slowly resolve the underlying problems.\n\n5. PTSD Is Not a Disease, But It Is a Disability \n\nPhysical pain is also a common symptom of ptsd. There are some people who have ptsd from experiences with chronic pain,  but ptsd itself can cause headaches,  body aches, stomach problems, heaviness in their body's making it hard to move around and more. It's yet another fact about the condition that can make simply living life much more difficult and that's one reason helping someone with ptsd do chores can be helpful. It can also be tiring to have to explain over and over that what they have isn't going to spread to someone else and it can be embarrassing to admit they get so stressed out it effects how they feel physically. If it seems like they aren't doing much then try to understand and get them help with the actual problem instead of calling them lazy. If they tell you they are struggling with something because of their mental health,  remember they aren't just making excuses they are dealing with genuine disability that at times can be quite debilitating. Do you think you'd function just as well on no sleep and afraid to close your eyes?\n\n6. It's Not Contagious Unless It Is \n\nOf course, ptsd isn't literally contagious, but being around someone who is suffering constantly can cause your own mental health to suffer and someone who cares about you would feel guilty if their issues were causing you a lot of distress. It's great to want to help someone, but you can only do that if you look after yourself. If you need a break, take it, and don't let your worries about them take over your life. \n\n7. You're Not in Danger Unless You Are \n\nNot all mentally ill people or people with ptsd are dangerous or violent, and not all abuse victims end up as abusers themselves. Don't assume you are in danger, even though some actions can look scary from the outside. Everyone behaves differently during ptsd flashbacks and other mental breakdowns and some people get quiet and still, but some people can yell and self-harm during flashbacks and that can look very scary but does not mean that person would ever hurt anyone else, so don't assume they will.  That being said,  people with ptsd are not all saints either,  they are just as capable of harming others as anyone else,  just not more so, and there are some cases where people with ptsd are violent during ptsd flashbacks, which isn't in their control and therefore isn't their fault, but you still need to protect yourself and,  at the very least, remove yourself from the situation long enough for them to at least get better to the point where they don't do that anymore if that does happen. Let's not pretend that a condition known to cause irritability, anger, and a lack of control can't make some people act in harmful ways. Once again don't let their ptsd be contagious and spread to you, for many reasons,  but for one it would be extremely difficult to repair a relationship between an abuser with ptsd and their victim who they caused to have ptsd. It actually might be better for you both to keep your distance in those situations. Basically,  people with ptsd are just people,  not monsters, not angels,  just people who can be good, bad or anything in between. \n\n8. They're Not Weak, but They Sure Feel Like They Are\n\nRegardless of what the trauma was, traumatized people tend to blame themselves for what happened and never feel they are doing enough to move on and grow. Tell them out loud it isn't their fault and celebrate their small victories even if they won't. Flashbacks in particular can make them feel like they aren't making progress. Flashbacks are more than just a very bad memory,  in their head they are reexperiencing the trauma all over again,  they might even act it out and feel retraumatized afterwards, so it's important to minimize flashbacks and for them to do something to calm down after having one. Recognizing and avoiding triggers is one way to have less flashbacks. Being triggered isn't hearing something that makes you a bit uncomfortable,  it can send people into a full-blown mental breakdown or cause them to reexperience their trauma. What triggers someone isn't always obvious,  even though at times it can be, someone who was yelled at by an abuser might be triggered by yelling,  but it's possible for that same person to be triggered by silence or a certain smell or being touched unexpectedly or in a certain way. Flashbacks can be seriously damaging to someone's mental health and that's why it's best to avoid triggers, when possible, but because it isn't always possible sometimes, they will have to manage triggers. This means doing something to better tolerate a trigger like taking a deep breath or going to a different room. You can help them by observing what might trigger them,  not setting off their triggers, and if you notice they're are getting upset or notice that one of their known triggers is present then don't touch them as that might be startling or make the situation worse, but tell them in a soothing voice that they should take a deep breath,  or do whatever psychological exercise seems to work for them. \n\n9. Reach Out but Not Too Much \n\nThe treatment for ptsd is based on connection so it's important to reach out even if it doesn't seem like they are always reaching back. That being said they will need space sometimes as well. It is on them to tell you that they need space, don't just assume they do, but if they say it then please respect it and try not to take it personally, it's most likely not even about you anyway, they're probably just exhausted or need some time to themselves to process something.\n\n10. No, They Can't Help It\n\nDealing with any mental illness at least requires life adjustments and will usually require professional care, significant amounts of time, effort, and support, and may even require hospital visits and treatments from specialists and ptsd is no exception. Even if the problem is in someone's head it doesn't mean they can just mind over matter it away. So, if someone can't help screaming during flashbacks for example, then they really cannot stop themselves any more than someone could stop themselves from having a seizure. If you really must have physical proof than look at the brain scans of mentally ill people, they are different from the ones of mentally healthy people. If they say they can't do something they mean it is not possible, not just that they don't want to do it or that it is very difficult, but that it is actually impossible, even if it's not obvious to you why they can't do it.\n\n11. The Answer to New Risky Behavior is Harm Reduction\n\nNew risky behavior is any behavior that could lead to them being harmed in some way that they did not participate in, at least as much, before. That could be anything from risky and/or more frequent sex and drug use to crossing streets without looking or speeding more often. You can talk to them about possibly getting help to stop these behaviors, but they will need professional help to do so and will only be able to quit when they're ready. The focus should be on making sure they are as safe as they can be even if they participate in risky behavior, that's what harm reduction means. For example, \nit would be better to make sure someone is practicing safe sex rather than commenting how much more sex they're having now or make sure they are testing their drugs and/or using clean needles rather than immediately forcing them into recovery. A lot of new risky behaviors are also unhealthy coping mechanisms and they won't be able to get rid of unhealthy coping mechanisms without learning healthy ones that work for them.\n\nIt is possible for symptoms to improve if they get the proper care, but it's very possible that ptsd will be something they will have to deal with for the rest of their lives. They might not ever be the same, but you can help on their journey towards healing."

Maybe it\u2019s the childhood I never had that I\u2019m mourning, or maybe the fact that I was unhappy, IDK. I\u2019m not diagnosed with PTSD (however, my therapist suspects that I have it), but I am diagnosed with depression. Sadness and depression goes hand in hand, but for me this is another type of sadness. It\u2019s not the numb sadness that comes with depression (but I still feel that as well), instead this is a new sadness that came along with the therapy. It feels like I\u2019ve lost something or that someone died.\n\nI had dinner with a friends family the other day, and the impression I got (a happy, normal and most importantly peaceful family), increased this feeling a lot. I had a massive panic attack the day after and didn\u2019t know how to handle the feeling of devastation that I felt. That\u2019s probably me overreacting a lot, but here we are.\n\nThis post is probably messy, I hope it makes sense to someone at least. I just wanted to ask if someone can relate. Maybe there is a more fitting subreddit for this, but I\u2019m choosing to post it here since I wanna know if this could be a symptom of PTSD. Of course a Redditor can\u2019t answer that for sure, but I hope you get the point.

    "title": "Cancer survivor; discovered a rare trigger today (TW: mild suicidal ideation, medical stuff) ",
    "content": "So for context I (23NB), was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer when I was 18 years old. To top it off this was in 2020 when the COVID pandemic was going on and I was immunocompromised due to the chemo so the whole thing was a lot scarier due to that. I took a gap year in my education 2020-2021 to go through 9 rounds of chemo, two surgeries, and over 7 weeks of radiation therapy. After my chemo was extended in Nov \u201820 my mental health took a sharp nosedive and for a couple months or so I wound up in the worst mental and emotional state of my life because I felt completely hopeless that I would get better and I got to a point where I really wanted to die. But treatment did eventually end and I slowly got better mentally and emotionally. I had a small recurrence in 2022-23 that didn\u2019t need chemo to treat and I have been NED ever since. \n\nI am a much happier person now and I\u2019m glad I survived, but pretty much every single day I remember my experience with cancer and how it could come back at any time and wreck havoc on my life and my plans like it did back then. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve mostly accepted and grown used to. It sucks, but those are the cards I\u2019ve been dealt and I try not to let it get to me too much. \n\nMy therapist (60sF) who I\u2019ve been seeing since the end of my treatment in 2021 is also a breast cancer survivor and we bonded a bit over that. I had a zoom appointment with her today and she told me that she\u2019s had a small recurrence that might require chemotherapy to treat. She seems pretty sure of her survival and didn\u2019t even seem upset at the thought of losing her hair when I suggested making a wig out of it. I wished her all the best and I plan on checking up with her soon. \n\nFor a couple hours after the appointment I just relaxed in my room but then out of nowhere it really just hit me and I had a meltdown I guess. It kinda feels selfish but I started to really freak out about the chances of my own recurrence. It was like in my mind I was going over the same thoughts I go through over and over again every single day but with these deep feeling of helplessness, fear, terror, anxiety, and despair. \n\nI just got a PET scan a few weeks ago and it came back completely clean but during my meltdown it felt like I had just been told I had another recurrence. I just had these horrible feelings in my gut and tears just kept flowing out of my eyes like a drippy faucet. I haven\u2019t had a genuine freak out moment about just the POSSIBILITY of a cancer recurrence in a long time. Then I remembered that something similar happened in 2021 when I was finishing up treatment and my friend J had a recurrence of his leukemia (he\u2019s healthy now). I remember when he told me I wished him the best obviously but just felt this deep sense of anxiety and helplessness about my own chance of recurrence. \n\nI kinda realized that, at least in my eyes, this fit the bill for a trauma trigger, and I don\u2019t use that term lightly. I almost never get triggered like that. Other than the two times mentioned above I remember during my recurrence my docs put me on some new pills to treat it but when I got them in the mail they were in this big ziploc bag labeled \u201cchemotherapy\u201d with a biohazard symbol on it. It really freaked me out as it looked just like the bag my epirubicen syringes were in when I got my first chemo infusion. This made me feel scared and helpless but instead of melting down I went on a spending spree and bought over $100 worth of edibles (its legal where I live) in a sort of \u201cwell I might be fucked let\u2019s live it up while I can\u201d attitude. Then there was the time just about a year ago when I got my annual mammogram and they thought I might have had fat necrosis (I didn\u2019t) so they scheduled an emergency breast ultrasound for me; when I was in the waiting room all alone I freaked out enough to kinda forget that fat necrosis isn\u2019t cancer and then I literally felt my emotions just turn off. It was like I knew panicking was pointless and I barely felt any emotions at all in a sort of \u201clet\u2019s get this shit done\u201d attitude and then after the ultrasound when I got the all clear my emotions came back and I just felt exhausted and relieved but mostly exhausted and a bit annoyed. \n\nI guess the proximity and tangible reality of the possibility of a recurrence or chemotherapy is what triggers me. I get monthly injections in my belly to prevent a recurrence and I don\u2019t get triggered there. When I get blood draws or scans I don\u2019t get triggered there. I never really thought of triggers with regards to my PTSD before today because it almost never happens to me. \n\nMy mom came home during my meltdown today and I tried to calm myself down but eventually let her in and we talked it out. I guess I\u2019m still a bit freaked but I\u2019m feeling better than earlier. \n\nI guess I\u2019m wondering what I should do if/when I get triggered like this again. Any advice or tips? I\u2019m also very open to answering questions or providing more context for my experiences if wanted/needed. "

I think this is a good idea because I won't always be able to speak properly, but I know I can reach into my bag and pull it out to show someone.\n\nIt would be great to get \"forms of words\" that I can write on this card, but I don't know how to word this.\n\nI would really need a calm and quiet space, and not to feel like I am being oggled or have to deal with anyone overbearing. I have concerns that I may have to deal with well-meaning good Samaritans who are too... smothering. \n\nAny ideas for what I can write, or even any ideas for what else might be useful to write down?"

I am still a virgin but I have been terrified of sex my whole life. And it has kind of been wavering with my fiance. \n\nI literally can\u2019t be fingered because it triggers me so bad. My fiance can\u2019t even play with my breasts without me having flashbacks and my whole body shutting down because I have so much shame and guilt flood through my body. I have so much pent up resentment because of them. Also, I have so much fear and anxiety that my fiance is only with me because of sex (when I know logically it\u2019s not true because we\u2019re waiting to actually have sex until we\u2019re married bc we\u2019re both virgins) and everytime I get triggered by him showing me his dick or him asking me if he could see my boobs immediately gives me serious flashbacks from my teenage years where I would do it for men but then they would leave. and I have serious abandonment trauma anyways. \n\nMy fiance knows all of this stuff and it\u2019s so hard sometimes. I love him with all my heart and soul and he is so wonderful and patient. He is constantly trying to help me feel safe and never pushes me to do anything. And assures me that even if we can\u2019t have sex because of my ptsd that he would stay with me. (He is a literal GEM) \n\nI just feel so much guilt, shame, and unworthiness. I am in a trauma therapy but my body will not let me open up and process it. It\u2019s been really hard trying to deal with these things. Sexual trauma isn\u2019t the only thing I have, along with PTSD, I have anxiety, OCD, and ADHD. I just need advice.\n\nIs there anything I can do to work on that trust with my fiance and help myself work through these things? Is exposing myself to doing sexually intimate things with my partner making it worse? Because when I am not triggers I love being intimate with him but when I am triggered (80% of the time) it just ruins it. Ugh I\u2019m just frustrated and idk what to do. \n\nSorry for the long post. Any help is welcome \u2764\ufe0f also be gentle I have OCD and I will be anxious about this post hahaha. "

They were finally going through a divorce and then she got cancer\u2026 She had an operation and treatment which seem to work. \nIt brought up a lot of feelings and memories and I noticed it got harder to deal with. I spoke to my gp and got put on a waitlist for therapy. Almost two weeks ago I got diagnosed with PTSD because of childhood trauma (but if I think about it the mental abuse didn\u2019t stop until the no contact when I was 24). \nIn two weeks I will start with therapy. Imaginairy exposure therapy to be exact. Edmr was an option but there was a waitlist of a few weeks for it. \nI read what they send me. I have to record the sessions and listen to them 5 times a week and also expose myself to things related to the trauma of that session. For me that means going back to my childhood home, visiting a few others places where I endured trauma and eating food that I haven\u2019t eaten since I was 15 (because then I learned to cook for myself and didn\u2019t have to eat rice or pasta anymore). It also said I should talk about the sessions and maybe listen to it with someone I trust so that it makes it easier to talk about and takes away the feelings. \nThey also think I might need more therapy after that to deprogram how I think about myself. \n\nI\u2019m kinda scared of what it\u2019s all going to do in my head. I know it\u2019s gonna be hard. Especially because I can\u2019t really talk to anyone about it. I have a bit of family left but they don\u2019t know about the ptsd and what happened and I don\u2019t want to burden them with that. Don\u2019t want them to think it\u2019s their fault for not noticing or whatever. \nThe two people I consider to be my closest friends both have their own fair share of trauma so I don\u2019t want to burden them with mine. \nI kinda want to tell another friend I\u2019m going to start therapy but that friendship is kinda new and with everything that happened in his life the past year I also don\u2019t want to burden him. \nI also don\u2019t want to become a problem at work. My boss knows what\u2019s going on and she is supportive. But I\u2019m just scared it\u2019s going to make me so tired and stressed that my work isn\u2019t going to be good enough. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to expect.

You might cross them in the mere instant of passing through a door, or you might find many small voids suddenly coalescing into a years-long sprawl with your existence all this time now just islands in the nothing.\n\nI don't know if I'm making any sense. I don't even think I should be talking about any of this. I already don't want it to be real, but it's the only thing I see that no one else can and it's very, very hard to describe what it is and what it's doing to me. I'm already falling apart as a person, but I can't give up, not while my wife is with me, the one person who I will never be able to do without. I could shut off everything except incidental human contact and be okay if it meant still that I would get to be with her every day.\n\nI'm getting off topic. \n\nOver the last four years, I've had floor therapists retire. I've had two psychiatrists retire; I've had one psychiatrist closed off to me by their corporate overlords because I lost my Medicaid and got backbilled a few hundred dollars I cannot afford, and I've rejected two psychiatrists for being wildly out-of-touch. Then there's retired oral surgeons (I need all my teeth replaced), two retired neurosurgeons (who said surgery for the problem with my spinal cord is so high risk for complications they would only do it in an emergency situation), and retired general practice. \n\nI can't find any escape. I need to dissociate HARD. I'm fact, if I could dissociate and give someone else control of this body and all my memories and personality, they could have it. I can't find escape in the things I once loved. I gave up TV and film ages ago. Reddit is the last patch of social media I use, and I've already blocked all notifications so it's only a matter of time until it will be the last time I remember to open this app. YouTube is in the same situation. If not those, what do I have left but my games\u2014more to the point, my semi-interactive fictions, though a game of Balatro or Civ can hardly be called literature. It's so hard to find good stuff to play, and so much of the good stuff anyway just reminds me of how big those voids are getting with every one of them I finish. Some days, I can't decide if it's time to do little more than wake up, eat, interact with my wife when she wants, but otherwise just do nothing I am not compelled to do. Laying awake, in bed, head empty, basically catatonic, empty. Capable, but empty. A rich internal life, but empty. Friendly, empathetic, real, emotive, genuine, but empty.\n"

I was EXTREMELY close to hitting a stone wall and a telephone pole but I swerved out of the way of them before ending up on the sidewalk and finally getting the car to stop. \nAll I remember is seeing the lights of the car pulling out in front of me and jerking away, a lot of shaking, screaming my head off a lot and next thing I know my car is on the sidewalk and the other driver has stopped and seeing if I'm okay.\nPhysically I'm fine but I was really shaken up at the time.\nThe car was wrecked. Front hanging off, tires blown out and we don't know if there was any damage to the underside yet. The mechanics are saying worst case scenario there's a possibility the car will be totaled. \nWhat I don't understand is how much it's still getting to me. \nPhysically I am completely fine. I only experienced soreness for one day. My airbags didn't even go off.\nI'm using my parents car now right now but every time I drive I'm tense and jumpy. And anyone suddenly stopping in front of me or pulling too closely behind me has gotten me having these mini panic attacks. I feel miserable after every drive.\nI get I could've gotten hurt or even died if I hadn't done what I did, but- I'm fine. So why am I still getting so upset? And I've been very depressed all week since it happened. I can't stop thinking about it. \nEveryone, including the other driver, is telling me it wasn't my fault and I got out of what could've been life-threatening danger very well- But it doesn't quite register with me? I feel guilty that the car was damaged. I feel guilty that the other driver is paying for things and feeling bad about it.\nI'm fine! I wasn't hurt. There was no crash- And my brain is acting like it was this huge deal.\nI have CPTSD and PTSD from past events and abuse so I'm no stranger to what trauma, anxiety and depression feel like.\nBut over this?

Waiting for something to go wrong so I can go to work. \n\nI also fought in Afghanistan 2008-2010. I was infantry and got my fair share of \u201caction.\u201d I came back a little fucked up but pushed forward. Now I can\u2019t even begin to go back into those memories without going into that heightened arousal state, then subsequently use alcohol to bring me down. I\u2019ve done my best to leave that part of my life behind me and not \u201creminisce.\u201d\n\nA guy from the unit I was with wrote a book. \u201cDamn the valley\u201d I bought it and it\u2019s been sitting on my shelf for two years. Unopened. I want to read it but I am worried about the effect it would have on me. How much alcohol I would have to consume to balance it out and stay on the ground. So it sits on the shelf, in plain view but unopened, like all the shit stacked up inside my brain, that I don\u2019t open. \n\nI guess the \u201cfirst step\u201d is always admitting there is something wrong. I\u2019ve gone 15 years saying \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Meanwhile adding to the pile of shit locked away in my brain. \n\nThis year I\u2019ve been approached by several of my coworkers and encouraged to go to therapy. One invited me to his garage after shift and we sat and talked about trauma and his experience with EMDR. I started with \u201cI\u2019m good, I don\u2019t need that yet.\u201dAnd by the end I was holding back as hard as I could to not completely break down.\n\nI guess it\u2019s time to admit that I\u2019m not good. Im not fine. \n\nI\u2019m pretty fucked up. "

My counselor was ofc upset by this response and redirected me to another clinic where I was met with understanding and amazing worker's who took my condition seriously. I was signed up for a trauma focused CBT treatment that started in early spring. I spent 1-1,5 hours there every week for months. It was hard, a lot of times I had to force myself to go there, but I went. My therapist said early on that the goal is not to completely get rid of my PTSD since it did not seem attainable but rather to make the symptoms more manageable and to make me feel like I had controll of my life. She said that I will still choose to not do certain things but it is important that that is my decision to make, not the decision of my condition.\n\nIt helped me to understand how some of my behaviours are connected and how I can overcome them. Today I try to be more open about my diagnosis, though none of my family members know.\n\nI am so thankful for the support I have received from the staff at the clinic and the people around me who have supported me this past year, the years prior and the coming year.

Since the beginning of October 2024, I had been seeking professional help due to a relapse of my depression and anxiety, caused by PTSD that was triggered when I had to get on a plane.\n\nI\u2019m not from here, I\u2019m from another country. I had already received psychological help before, and I was able to improve a lot, get stronger, and move forward, of course with the help of a psychologist and anxiety medication.\n\nI ended up seeking professional help here in the United States. I went to the local mental health center in the city I\u2019m living in, it\u2019s free. I managed to get them to prescribe me medication (even though I feel like they never really properly evaluated me to give me the right medicine). They gave me medication for anxiety and depression.\n\nThe thing is, everything changed on November 4th, 2024. That day, I was fine, I had a lot of things to do, and I was feeling okay, with a little anxiety, so I decided to take my anxiety pill (which I had only taken once before, this would be the second time) and it caused the worst effect instead of calming me down. I felt like I had lost my mind. My boyfriend wasn\u2019t home, only my roommate was there. I called my boyfriend to come home because I couldn\u2019t calm down. I started screaming with all my strength, I lost the strength in my body, I was falling, and I could only scream. I started twitching in painful ways, I really thought I was going to die. My boyfriend ended up calling 911 because he got scared. When they arrived at the house, not only the ambulance came but also the police. Imagine a person having a horrible panic attack, with police and paramedics in their living room, in their safe space. I couldn\u2019t calm down, seeing them and them cornering me made me feel so sick. They took my blood pressure and temperature. They said I had a fever and needed to go to the hospital to rule out an allergic reaction to the medication I had taken. That was from the paramedic, who was quite sweet and helpful. They asked me to go in the ambulance with my boyfriend, but I just couldn\u2019t move, I was so scared to go with them. So that\u2019s when the police intervened and told me that I had to go or \u201cthings were going to get worse.\u201d I wanted to go but mentally I just couldn\u2019t, and my body was flooded with panic. Since I didn\u2019t comply, the police forced me onto the sofa, hurting me physically while handcuffing me. I screamed in pain and fear, I never thought something like this would happen to me. My panic was beyond the sky, it was uncontrollable at this point. With my hands handcuffed, they took me to the police car, barefoot because they didn\u2019t let me find my shoes. I screamed, I cried, I begged them not to make me do this. The police officer just told me to shut up and started driving at high speed down the highway. We got to the hospital, and I entered, barefoot, handcuffed, screaming, and crying. Everything hurt. They took me to a room and handcuffed me to the bed. The nurses mocked me and told me to be quiet. They didn\u2019t want to give me water. One nurse came with a glass, a mocking face, and told me, \u201cI\u2019ll only give you water if you stop crying.\u201d It was so humiliating. They kept me in the hospital for 9 hours, not telling me anything. They took off the handcuffs because \u201cI was behaving.\u201d I was just crying. Later, I got to see my boyfriend, and then I called my family, who were worried in another country, thinking the worst had happened to their daughter. I left the hospital 9 hours later, with a police officer saying, \u201cYeah, sorry, it was all a misunderstanding, you can go now.\u201d\n\nI never felt so humiliated in my life. Now my nervous system is completely messed up. I have trauma from that. Since that day, I\u2019ve been in fight or flight mode. The therapist I sought here simply didn\u2019t help, and neither did the psychiatrist. I\u2019m dealing with so much anxiety every day, I\u2019m having a lot of relapses, and it\u2019s becoming really hard to move forward. I haven\u2019t gone out with my friends in months, and this is becoming difficult to handle.\n\nI just wanted to vent. I hope this doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else, and that they train the police in this country better to learn how to handle panic attacks or anything related to mental health.\n\n"

I remember I was sitting in a 120 degree porta potty, fighting for my life while trying to shit. But mid way though that, I heard \u201cincoming! Incoming!\u201d Over the loud speaker and then C-RAMs buzzing. At first I was thinking it\u2019s a drill cause it\u2019s not crazy for that to be going off though out the week.

And the explosions starting getting louder and louder to the point we\u2019re it\u2019s like a fire cracker going off next to your ear. But all I could really think about was \u201cman, dying on this toilet would be a really shitty way to die\u201d then I started thinking about \u201cwhat if one mortar lands right next to me and a piece of shrapnel cuts though this plastic porta potty and shreds my brains\u201d and that was all I could think about, me: dead in a porta potty. Then after it was all over, we took a head count, nobody was injured and we continued our work day. \n\nBut nowadays whenever I think of that, I get emotional, I feel scared, weak and just less of a person. I think about how my friends would\u2019ve seen me if I would\u2019ve been killed. It\u2019s even worse when I think about my mom seeing me like that. In a casket with an American flag over me. I love serving my country and I love what I do.

I just needed to spill the beans for some people I don\u2019t know me or whatever. Maybe I\u2019ll even inspire somebody else to have the same resolution with me. "

I usually am very private and secretive about my PTSD, my best friend is the only other person who is aware of it, and I'm generally a pretty emotionally guarded person. Lately I've been trying to push myself to be more open and communicative about my emotions because I feel like that emotional avoidance is usually what pushes me to feel self isloated and lonely, and is often the downfall in my relationships.My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 3 months now, he has mental health issues of his own and we've been able to help each other open up in ways we haven't in other relationships and we have a strong mutual understanding that I haven't felt with another partner before. \n\nSo instead of my usual self isolating in this situation I texted my boyfriend and asked him if I could crash at his place for the night because I was freaking out a little going to sleep and thought it would help if I had another person in the room with me. When I got to his place he started offering solutions to help me sleep but I explained to him that I have PTSD and that I probably got triggered by something earlier in the day that made my fight or flight react and that j just needed to calm my anxiety and my heart rate. He didn't seem phased or reactive at all when I opened up, instead he tried to accommodate me as best he could, invited me on an outing with his friends for the next night, told me he loved me, and checked on me intermittently. Writing it all out now is making me realize that it's probably not as big a deal as I'm making it out to be, but I can't help feeling stupid, ashamed, and guilty for telling him that I have PTSD. I'm second-guessing if telling him was the right thing to do.\n\nI've noticed a lot of posts of other people with PTSD/cptsd saying that it's better off to never tell anyone about their condition, and that no one really needs to know because they'll never understand. But honestly I feel like the opposite is true, I think if you want a healthy long-term relationship with someone you should put everything out on the table and communicate, but on the other hand I still feel very anxious about the entire night.

I researched sunflower oil's boiling point and, without further a doubt, I turned the stove on and waited for it to heat up. Now, oil doesn't react to heat as water does, and it's very hard to see the signs of overheating. \n\nThe last red flag I should've seen was the oil producing smoke and smelling burnt, right before the inevitable flame started. I was at all times near the stove and when I saw the fire starting, I got immediately weak and overwhelmed. It was like watching a fiasco starting to happen and having to stop it ASAP. \n\nNow, I was informed about grease fires and how if water is thrown on them they immediately expand, so I quickly took a bowl and placed it over the fire, after which I quickly turned the heat off. The scariest part of this is I was alone, my parents away for 2 days and having to handle the fire all by myself. Images of it expanding and wrecking down my house were flying across my head as I closed the window and door of the kitchen so oxygen wouldn't circulate and fuel the fire. I tried switching the bowl on top of the kettle with the fire to a lid, but immediately after I took the bowl off the oil caught fire again, even more intensely. The fire kept going under my bowl and getting stronger, then weaker, then stronger again. I was terrified.\n\n  \nThe fire got pretty darn big, but I managed to suffocate it. The questions left were... What would've happened if a week previously I wouldn't have watched some insignificant Youtube video about grease fires and the dangers they behold? What if I would've thrown water on the fire, unknowingly, and expand the fire? I got 2 burns on my hand, but what if I wouldn't have known how to settle the fire? What if this fire would've ended my life horrifically?\n\n  \nNow, at night, I struggle to sleep while looking through other fire stories. I know my incident isn't nearly as overwhelming as others -- heck, my fire was around the height of an average arm, but I am still unable to sleep. I feel the smoke again, how I felt when I saw the flame and how I felt knowing the fire may start again, or the bowl might break which would make the oil fire spill across the floor. I feel like at any moment, somewhere in my house, a fire could start, I imagine how my whole building is engulfed in flames and I am left surrounded in them, basically just worrying about how the situation could derail, only having not had the information about grease fires. Perhaps, a decision of reading an article one month ago is what saved my life now.\n\nPSA: My parents DO know about the incident I had.\n\nI want to hear more fire survivor stories and how you got over the trauma of it. Thanks!"

    "content": "I guess I am technically. Manslaughter maybe. I\u2019m 17. But I would right now have a 3 year old child. Obviously having a toddler at 17 wouldn\u2019t be ideal. And I\u2019m mentally ill. But I didn\u2019t want my baby to die. I got pregnant at 14 from rape. I had already been raped and abused multiple times in my life. And this time I was humiliated online because my rapist filmed and took pictures. And posted them and sold them online. \n\nThe police didn\u2019t do anything. So a few weeks after the rape I tried to kill myself and was in a coma for a day. After I got released from hospital I was still suicidal. So I was drinking and doing drugs to cope. For months but a started to gain weight rapidly and get sickness and cravings and stuff and I was worried. I looked pregnant too. I was in denial though. My whole life I wanted to one day have a big family with lots of children. But like WAY in the future.\n\nI was scared of taking a pregnancy test because I didn\u2019t want it to be true. But I did stop hurting myself and doing drugs incase I was pregnant because I didn\u2019t want hurt my baby if I was pregnant. I was so scared of my family and friends disowning me I didn\u2019t tell anyone about my fear of being pregnant. I wasn\u2019t allowed out of the house on my own because of the suicide attempt. So I didn\u2019t want to have to ask my family and I was scared if I\u2019d ask the GP they\u2019d have to tell my parents.\n\nA few more months went by and I started to accept it. And I decided I was going to take a pregnancy test. Because my parents allowed me to go to town with my friend in a week from when I decided to take the test. I decided I was going to steal a pregnancy test without her noticing while we went shopping. And I honestly started to in a maybe messed up way love my child. I thought it was a sign I needed to get better. And stay alive. So I could give my baby a good life. \n\nI knew it was going to be hard but I also thought it would be worth it. And I started thinking about names and looking at baby clothes and saving money up. I for some reason decided I didn\u2019t want an abortion at this point. And I didn\u2019t want to have to give up my baby so I was going to keep it and I felt comforted knowing I would have someone who needs me. Which I know isn\u2019t the way to go about having a baby but I genuinely thought the universe was giving me this child so I\u2019d turn my life around and all my problems will be solved. \n\nBut then a few days before meeting my friend I started my period again. I was in extreme agony and within seconds the blood had already soaked through my underwear and my bed. And I was screaming in pain. My parents thought it was just a really heavy period and my mother gave me these really thick pads she uses when she has her period. And I was telling her I don\u2019t think this is normal and she said it happens to her sometimes when she has a heavy period and she gave me paracetamol. I ended up crawling because I felt really faint and in pain and couldn\u2019t walk to the bathroom to put on the pad but threw up when I got there. Then I was putting on the pad and the deformed baby came out. Like it was a fully formed feetus but in peices. I could make out its and hands and feet and head. And I started sobbing. \n\nI felt like it was all my fault. And I still do. I shouldn\u2019t have done drugs or alcohol or tried to kill myself then my baby would\u2019ve lived. And it was pretty far along so it might\u2019ve felt the pain by that point. \n\nI\u2019m not against abortion I was considering abortion but I had chosen to have this baby. Now I have fertility issues and will probably never be able to have a baby. And even if I could I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be mentally able to. After the miscarriage I went back to my old ways of drinking and doing drugs. And trying to kill myself. The baby was what I changed for. Yet that still wasn\u2019t good enough. "

I was raped for the first time when I was 8 this continued until I was 14 and I actually got pregnant and had a miscarriage from it at 14 and had videos and photos of it sold online. I also got badly bullied my whole life. Sometimes even physical. At 11 someone attempted to drug and kidnap me. It\u2019s all not fair. Obviously I\u2019m a fucked up mess.\n\nEverything has been taken from me. My first kiss,my first orgasm,my first time masturbating. That all happened when I was 8 because my rapist made me. Also all of my friends throught my life have left me because I\u2019m too mentally fucked up. My child even though I didn\u2019t want it was taken from me because of the miscarriage which was because I did drugs and alcohol and attempted suicide probably before I knew I was pregnant to deal with the trauma.\n\nI also lost my sister who hates me because I\u2019m a suicidal drug addict. And now even my parents. They were the only ones I had left but recently they told me once I\u2019m 18 I\u2019m being kicked out because they can\u2019t deal with me being like this anymore. But I\u2019m so mentally and physically ill I can\u2019t get a job. And because I\u2019m 17 most places in my area either take unpaid people my age or only hire people who are 18+. I do have a bit of money from disability allowance from the government. \n\nAnd I was trying to save up my money so I could get an apartment for a month when I\u2019m 18 if I don\u2019t have a job by then so I\u2019d have a month to get a job which would probably be easier when I\u2019m 18.

Because who cares anyway. I\u2019ve already been exploited my whole life.\n\nBut even though I\u2019ve been trying to save up being sober is tough so I\u2019ve been wasting my money on drugs and vapes and alcohol anyway. Even though I know I shouldn\u2019t and I need the money without hit I can\u2019t handle living. It\u2019s the only thing stopping me from killing myself. But also I do want to die. And it feels like the best option right now. I mean I\u2019m going to have no where to live on top of this? I won\u2019t be able to hack it. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair. I shouldn\u2019t be in this situation. I should\u2019ve never been hurt and abandoned at that age. I should\u2019ve been able to grow up normally. And find out things on my own sexually. And have friends and a boyfriend and get good grades and then I\u2019d be able to get a job once I was 18 or go to university or with my family.

after another in my life most of the time and i dont know how to deal with it being slightly more stable right now.\n\nin the past 4 years ive moved between my mom and dad's houses 4 times, 2 of which was because i was kicked out and made to live with the other parent for various reasons.\n\nwhen i was 13 it was because i came to the realization that im not cis and would rather be a boy than a girl most of the time, im still trying to figure out what exactly i am, but ive figured out that much. my mom found out, had a temper tantrum, told me she \"wouldnt trade her daughter for a son\" and that \"im a girl, so i better start acting like it\". she locked me in the car after we dropped my sister off at school and yelled awful things at me the whole drive home. she told me that im sick in the head, should be locked in a mental hospital, that she didnt raise a \"disgusting transexual deviant\", and how people like me shouldnt be allowed to live. she kept me locked in the car an additional 10 minutes after we got home and continued to scream at me. when she finally unlocked the door, i flung myself out of the car, ran inside, and sat in a burning hot shower. im not very religious, but that day i remember praying through my tears, sobbing to any god that was out there that would listen to me to please make it all a bad dream; to just let me wake up in my bed and realize it was all an awful nightmare that didnt actually happen.\n\ni was made to live with my dad after that.\n\nwhen i was 15 i was kicked out of my dad's house after he looked at my search history and saw me looking up the process of emancipation and looking into HRT. i had come out to my dad that summer when i was 14, and he didnt have a particularly supportive reaction. he told me that he doesnt believe i actually want to be a boy, but that i think it would make my life easier and that im doing it to be different. as if i would want to be part of one of the most targeted communities in the american south to \"make my life easier\". makes absolutely no sense. the whole reason i was looking into emancipation was because i saw a news article about it. the idea that i might try going for it was there in the back of my head, but it wasnt an active plan. me and my dad spent most of our time arguing. we'd get into fights about things that werent important, and he would yell and scream at me. sometimes i would threaten to call CPS, because a few testimonies from me and he'd never see his kids again. a couple of times my 5 year old brother stood between us and told him to leave me alone and that if our dad hurt me, he would hurt him.\n\na week before my baby brother's 4th birthday one summer when i was living with my dad, my grandpa burst into the living room yelling at me to stop being such a fuck up and actually be apart of the fucking family. that if i would just act right we wouldnt have any of the problems we were dealing with at the time, and that i was being disgracful.\n\ni had told my dad about it when i got home, and he apparently told his dad to knock it off, but left me to believe he didnt care and never told me he handled it. then it was somehow my fault for not talking to my dad or grandpa unless i had to for a few weeks.\n\nevery time me and my dad would argue, he would throw the fact that he married my mom and adopted me when i was a baby in my face. i hated it, still do. im not even allowed to look at my DNA test results because it makes HIM uncomfortable, even though we havent spoken in half a year.\n\nim back to living with my mom now, because my dad told her that he was done with me and couldnt deal with me anymore. she ignores me not being cis, pretends that im her sweet little girl and her precious daughter. at this point ive learned to just hide the discomfort when she calls me that and try and keep myself from physically cringing. she lets me wear mens clothes and use mens products as long as i dont say i would rather be a boy, so theres no sense in complaining.\n\ni had tried to see my dad over the summer, i really had. i made it a week before we got into a screaming match. he yelled at me over mens bodywash, and escalated the situation to saying that im a disrespectful, manipulative, pathological liar of a brat that twists the narrative of anything to victimize myself. all i do is tell it like it happened with the information i have if someone asks.\n\ni was fully expecting to be kicked out and homeless by now, because i havent managed to stay with one parent more than a year at this point. fortunately, i wasnt, because i dont have much, let alone the means to support myself, im only making 100 bucks per paycheck right now.\n\ni had a major problem with my old math teacher at the beginning of the school year before i transferred classes. she yelled at my whole class and called us idiots and said we were all dumber than 6th graders, in a fucking algebra 2 class. the yelling made me have a flashback, and i had a panic attack in class. my poor friend, alex, was trying to help me, but i couldnt register that it was him. i thought he was my dad and i started crying before he managed to help me realize where i was.\n\nmy mom had me switched out of her class.\n\ni was harassed by a boy in my ag class at the beginning of the school year. its not the first time ive been harassed by someone, but it made me scared to walk to class alone, because his friends would yell after me asking why i didnt like him. it wasnt even full blown sexual harassment, he just wouldnt leave me alone depite me being obviously uncomfortable.\n\none of my friends found out about it after he quit bothering me for the most part, and he keeps telling me to let him know if he ever starts it up again any time this kid says anything to me, since he sits on the opposite side of my friend to me in my ag class.\n\nhell, just this week, my mom told some random guy she drove around for uber where i work despite being hyperskeptical of strangers after multiple cases of family members being taken advantage of. she told him where i work. he showed up at my job asking for me before my shift started and my manager told him i wasnt on the schedule for the day just so he wouldnt show up again later. after i heard about it, i asked my mom why she would tell some random guy where i work and her response was \"because we were having a conversation, dont question me\".\n\ni turn 16 in less than a month and im already so fucked up in the head.\n\ni cant sleep with the door open because my parents have thrown my door open in the middle of the night multiple times and started yelling at me or raiding my room, so now im scared to leave the door open because there wouldnt be a warning if someone was coming in.\n\ni cant have my closet fully closed or open because my mom raided it in the middle of the night when it was fully closed and left it open for me to see that i have no power and she can take whatever she wants when she wants when i was 13 shortly before she kicked me out. i have to have one of the doors open and the other closed or else it stresses me out.\n\nbeing yelled at is enough to send me into a panic attack or put me on the defensive depending on the day. i'll either breakdown or i'll start picking someone apart at a fundamental level just to make them stop.\n\nif i bring up any type of traumatic event from when i was little, my parents tell me that my childhood wasnt abusive or traumatic and that i have a warped sense of reality because they dont remember any of what im talking about or they dont remember it happening that way, so now i feel like i cant trust my very limited memories of my life.\n\nim so sick of feeling like im crazy or waiting for the other shoe to drop, its insane. at this point i dont know what actually happened and what my brain made up as an excuse for any of my shitty behaviour.\n\nif any of you have similar experiences, or understand where im coming from, please let me know. im sick of feeling like im alone with this.\n\ni hate the fact that theres only one place i can sit in the car that doesnt make me anxious thanks to being yelled at for entire car rides. i hate that i still have nightmares about when my mom kicked me out when it happened almost 3 years ago. \n\ni hate that i dont like most people touching me because girls in middle school would grab and harass me at school and call me things like \"girlyboy\" and say i have \"henti thighs\". \n\ni hate that i lost most of my empathy because of being relentlessly teased and constantly being kicked out of friend groups for things i either didnt do or didnt know i did because no one would tell me in the most humiliating ways possible, typically either in school hallways or cafeterias. i hate that it always left me in tears, running off into the library barely keeping it together before i could find i secluded area to completely lose it. i hate that i never know what i did to make everyone else hate me a treat me like some sort of freak or a toy they can throw away without rhyme or reason.\n\ni hate it all, and i wish i wasnt so damn fucked up. im not even done with highschool. im almost 16 and all of this shit just keeps hitting me and the punches dont stop. im so sick of it."

    "content": "I had a pretty rough childhood, especially my teenage years. I\u2019ve struggled with trauma, and my older brother was diagnosed with CPTSD from our childhoods so I might\u2019ve even been dealing with something like that. I was pretty stagnant in my mental health issues and felt a weird sense of familiarity/comfort (if that\u2019s the right word) in the symptoms I had been experiencing for the majority of my life. But recently my mom died gruesomely in front of me, and I\u2019m experiencing new issues that are really inhibiting my life and which I don\u2019t have any clue how to handle. The smallest things set me off into crazy dissociative states where I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing \u2014 if I\u2019m in public I go into autopilot, and if I\u2019m alone I curl into a ball. Auditory cues are the worst, because I can almost never expect them. My roommates smoke alarm is low on batteries, and while trying to reset it, he accidentally made the alarm in my room beep one time. This freaked me out so bad that I started having what I assume was a panic attack, but was much more \u201cstill\u201d than the ones I had before my mom\u2019s death. The beeping reminded me so clearly of a specific moment during her death that I really felt like I was there again. I just stopped what I was doing, covered my ears, and curled into a ball on my bed shaking. This has been happening more and more and I\u2019m not sure how to move forward. It\u2019s only a matter of time before I freak out in front of my girlfriend or my friends, since the whole autopilot thing has been working less and less. Sorry for the long rant, I just don\u2019t know what to do."

I got braces in 2019 and planned to have them taken off in 2020, then covid messed everything up. my dentist closed for covid restrictions and i had my braces an additional 2 years. the thing is, i went through a lot from 2019-2023, and i didn\u2019t take care of my teeth. i brushed them like once a week and rotted in a depression pit the rest of the time. when i went in to finally get my braces taken off, i was informed i had like 12 cavities. \n\nIve always been afraid of needles since i can remember, i know all kids are but i would kick and scream at poor doctors/dentists just trying to do their job. i was held down a lot as a kid screaming and crying while getting the shots/bloodwork done, and now i feel more afraid than ever. They told me ill have to get atleast 4 shots in all 4 corners of my mouth to numb me, and i couldn\u2019t stand the thought of it. 4 shots?? in my mouth?? ATLEAST?? To top it all off i have genetics that make me process and wear off numbing quicker than most people so thats great. \n\nI tried to go in and get it done with anxiety meds and laughing gas, the anxiety meds didn\u2019t do ANYTHING for me. I was shaking, crying, and dissociating on the way as usual. I tried to keep calm and just get it over with, but when they put the laughing gas on me i FREAKED. OUT. They had a finger clip thing on me that showed my heart rate, my heart rate got up to 180 bpm before they stopped and informed my mom i would have to be further sedated. \n\nHere i am now, im still working on getting a therapist to do exposure therapy with, but now i have a new problem. I have a decent sized cavity in my side front tooth. its not in your face noticeable, but i haven\u2019t smiled with my teeth in a while. I just feel so defeated and hopeless. \n\nI had my girlfriend come with me for blood work that i had been putting off for the same reason. Me and my (old) therapist made a plan, i asked for their best stick and told them i have a needle phobia, and i did it! i got all 4 vials of blood drawn and with barely any crying! it went amazing and really made me feel more confident. The dentist is just such a bigger step though, i know now i can handle one needle, but what if i freak out when i get 4? \nAny advice or anything is very appreciated. I just feel so alone when it comes to this and embarrassed. anyone else have dentist/needle related ptsd?"

    "title": "What happened at the shelter (CW: severe animal abuse)",
    "content": "Hey guys, so it\u2019s a little hard to talk about but I wanted to write a bit about a traumatic experience I had in the past, as well as the effects its had on my mental health. I figured this was the best place to talk about it since it\u2019s a really difficult situation to explain to anyone who hasn\u2019t gone through a similar experience. I also find it really hard to actually verbalize rather than just writing it out.\n\nThis happened a few years ago, the summer before my freshman year of high school. I had one of my really good friends who was a few years older than me come out to visit family for the summer, and we decided to get volunteer jobs together. We went to this animal shelter a little bit out of town to find work, and we were gladly accepted since they were severely understaffed. \n\nThe shelter was\u2026 terrible to say the least? It\u2019s hard to actually describe it in words, verbal or otherwise, as it\u2019s such a visceral memory. Firstly, it was filthy. I don\u2019t even think the word filthy even describes it accurately, its was decrepit and so vile that even remembering some of the things I saw make me ill. There was rotting food and maggots everywhere, pretty much every kind of excrement all over the floor, mold on the ceiling and walls, just to name a few things. This isn\u2019t even to mention the overcrowding, this shelter was taking in at least 3x the amount of animals as it should be.\n\nWe were repulsed. Soon after, we found out that the shelter was being ran and almost exclusively care-taken by only one old woman. This lady was insane, theres no kinder way to put it. She was an old polish lady (and was also an ex navy seal instructor if i\u2019m remembering correctly???) She lived out of the office at the shelter and slept on a lice infested futon. She used to scream at us for what gelt like hours, berating us for anything from using the wrong setting on the washing machine to taking too long of water breaks (mind you we were trapped in an unventilated acrid room in the middle of summer in the tropics). One memory of mine involves her forcing me to hold a door shut while several aggressive, large dogs were growling at me to let them out. My friend also recalls a time when she was forced to bury 2 dead kittens out in the front yard.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t quit, or call animal control or something. I think I felt like I was making a difference, and I was scared of what would happen if I left. I worked mainly with the cats, and when I would take even just one day off the room would be trashed. Plus, the shelter was apparently in the middle of relocating to a different town, so I think I thought it would get better after moving and gaining some more employees. For some sick reason I felt like it was my responsibility to be a caretaker to all of these animals, like I was the only one keeping them from living in revulsion.\n\nAnyways, I stopped working there my first week of freshman year and I thought that the whole ordeal was over, that I had made a difference with the work that I did and that was that. \n\nOn the Wednesday of that week, about midnight, I woke up to my mom pulling me out of bed.\nMy boss had killed herself and left all the animals alone without food and water for a whole week. In the middle of summer. \n\nI was so so devastated, I can barely describe the way I felt in that moment. I ended up having to testify to the police and draw them a map of the shelter since they didn\u2019t know what to expect when they went in there. My mom, trying to be a martyr as per the usual, insisted that she brought over dog food to the animals at the shelter. I told her not to go, since it was a crime scene, and I couldn\u2019t stress enough the things that she was about to walk into. Also it was dangerous. A bunch of animals who hadn\u2019t had anything to eat for a week except for each other, can you imagine? Still, despite my begging she still left. I\u2019ll never forget the feeling of sitting on my couch bawling my eyes out thinking that I had failed those poor babies. \n\nThats what hit me the hardest, was the guilt about how I could have stopped it all from happening. I forgot to mention it before, but my boss was always talking about how she was going to kill herself, and in retrospect I always felt like I could\u2019ve stopped her from doing what she did too. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell very many people about what happened, it would be too difficult to explain even if I wanted to. I still have only told my closest friends and my therapist about everything, and I doubt many others will get to hear about it straight from my mouth. Did you know my mom had actually forgotten that all of this happened to me? I brought it up in conversation and she was like \u201coh I forgot that your boss killed herself\u201d like what?????\n\nI struggled really hard after it happened, I wasn\u2019t able to drive past the shelter without physically gagging or throwing up in my mouth. I still have a very hard time with certain things, especially things like noises or smells. I used to work at a florist, and pretty much had to quit because our backrooms reminded me too much of the shelter. Certain acrid smells make me freak out, along with certain noises like dogs barking. I just recently adopted a kitten to help me cope with some of the things going on in my life (his name is spider, he\u2019s a little tuxedo cat\u2026 he\u2019s sitting on too of me right now while im writing this \ud83d\udc31), and I found it so incredibly difficult to clean his litter box without thinking about the shelter. I was also having bad nightmares about everything for a while, but then I started a new medication which made them stop.\n\nAnyways, thank you for reading this if you made it this far. I know it\u2019s a pretty unusual story, and theres a lot more I could go into about the whole situation. If anyone has any advice on coping with traumatic experiences, or even just any comments I would be happen to hear them. I hope you have a great day!! "

    "title": "Questions about PTSD (not looking for diagnosis, simply just wondering if my experiences line up with others)",
    "content": "So, long story short, I randomly got what I think is a memory to being SA'd by a family member when I was very young at a family reuinion, but I don't know if it's real or just my mind making things up. \nI got this \"memory\" about 2-3 years ago because I was watching a video about something similar. During the video I just suddenly got extremely uncomfortable and started crying and felt panicky and I didn't understand why until I suddenly had that memory. Before that I remembered a lot of things about that family reunion except the memories just cut off after a certain point during the reunion. I never really thought about that but it makes sense as I was about 4 or 5 at that time and all my memories of back then are hazy.\nBut I still have doubts the memory is even real. Did nobody see it happen when there were tons of people at the house? We were outside but wouldn't I have told someone? Maybe not as I barely tell anyone even now, but wouldn't I have not understood and told someone? The actions that they made me do don't make me uncomfortable at all when I consent to them now, shouldn't it? The feeling I get when I see certain things or hear about certain things (kids being SA'd or family members SAing each other) is far different that normal discomfort, but it's not like every time I hear that stuff I have a panic attack. But sometimes when I hear that stuff I just feel scared and want to cry. Maybe that never happened at all though and I just made it up because I wanted something wrong with me. I know I used to want something wrong with me because people caring for me felt good, but then again I don't tell anybody about it really. I'm perfectly fine with sex and even have been hypersexual a lot of my life (especially as a kid) but I guess it can make me really uncomfortable sometimes and I can even be disgusted by sex sometimes. \nIs this kinda stuff normal to experience with PTSD? I don't get nightmares, and if those spells of being really uncomfortable and crying and kinda dissociating (sometimes to the point I will change personality entirely and feel like I'm watching myself from outside my body while someone else controls it until I feel comfortable again, but that's really rare for me) count as panic attacks they're not super dramatic like a lot of panic attacks I see are. Things related to my trauma don't make me panic but they can do that uncomfortable thing I was just talking about, but only occasionally. Maybe that's just because it was so long ago? I don't know. I have no proof this memory even happened and I feel like I had no recollection of it before I got it, so maybe it didn't happen and my brain is lying to me, but maybe thinking its a lie is also a way of coping. I'm not sure. Does this even sound like PTSD?"

From this experience i got severe trust issues and became fearfull of any person I don't know.\n\nThings came to a breaking point during COVID since I wasn't going out wich helped me to be relaxed but worsened my social anxiety. I started therapy because I needed to go back to college (I was sa'd in campus). I was able to leave my house and go out with minor issues but my fear of people persisted. I keep't pushing on therapy but couldn't get over my fear of people to wich My therapist sugested opening a dating app profile saying I don't have to meet them in person unless I feel safe, this didn't work for me, I don't have social media and had a lot of issues to translate a conversation on app to a real life meeting.\n\nSo to help myself with my fear I try to go out alone and do whatever I feel like wich happened when my job closed for one day and I went to eat alone.

To this point i don't have any real reasons to feel afraid of this guy but the moment I tried to back out he got really insistent and tried to take off my clothes by force leaving me bruised in my arms and chest, i told him to stop or i would scream which worked and got to my house. Since that day i have this awful feeling of guilt, i don't want to admit to myself that he was going to hurt me and since is the first time i go to a date in 6 year i just can't stop hearing my mind going paranoid telling me that is always going to be this way.\n\nHow do you guys cope with this? I really can't see myself dating again, the future just seems so bleak, i barely have Friends since i'm so anxious around everyone.

I recently got a new partner (online) and they told me they'd had less than 10 partners before me (I've only had 1) and just now got tested positive for >!gonorrhea!<, this severely triggered my contamination anxiety even tho they got treated for it immediately.\n\nWe had plans about meeting irl but now the thought of intimacy with them makes me repulsed and panic. Logically I know this is just a human thing that can happen to anyone and I don't want to judge them because I still care deeply for them. But it feels like if me and them ever meet irl, especially if we were to do anything unprotected that I'd inherently be \"contaminated\" by them. \n\nIt'd basically make it feel like the trauma was happening all over again and that I would be getting \"tainted\". I've been trying to rationalize for hours and hours, telling myself about how cells regenerate, how they got the treatment for the STi and trying to reframe it as them having more experience/practice instead of it being a bad thing. It helped a bit, but I simply can't shake the idea of it inherently \"tainting me\" forever if I were to do anything with them.\n\nI can't afford therapy as it is now so I'd really like self help type of advice or if anyone else has had a fear like this and how you dealt with it\n\n"

    "content": "I'll try to write in a way that won't trigger anyone but if you need more details or specifics, please feel free to ask!\n\nHi all, I have (undiagnosed but all the signs are there) PTSD coming from 4 separate events in my childhood, all involving a different person. The thing is, sometimes when something triggers me, my flashbacks start as remembering what happened (which involved >!psychological harm and physical touch but not physical pain<!)but then evolve into even more traumatic stuff (from my perspective at least) which never happened. This evolvement includes >!physical harm and pain<! which is intense. Sometimes it's related to something I watch or read (especially watch), for example a scene involving someone who lives through a traumatic event related to the ones I had. My mind immediately goes forward and even if the person on the TV ends up getting saved or manages to stop the event, I see and feel flashbacks of what could have happened and I literally feel the pain and all the feelings as they were mine and the victim is me. But the false flashbacks can happen also randomly, like normal flashbacks.\n\nIs false flashbacks even a thing? What's happening?\n\nNow some possible TMI which do relate to false flashbacks but aren't necessary for the understanding of the post:  \n>!Yesterday I was doing something relating to the trauma topic with someone else but it was something good and I didn't get flashbacks or anything, it was a good event... and then the other person hurt me. 100% unintentionally. The pain was the same pain I always felt in those false flashbacks, this time it was real pain though. I ended up having an awful trauma response, first fawn (which prolonged the pain because the person didn't realize at first), then freeze then flight... It was awful and fighting very hard to not add this to my existing trauma.<!"

I have had the nightmares, the avoidance, it still pops in my head, the hyper vigilance, If a car comes too close, even if I'm on the sidewalk, it affects me. If I'm in a car I am fine. But I am a mess if I am a pedestrian, especially when it comes to where it all happened. It doesn't help that I also live on a busy road as well. (Btw my bf and I had the right of way, it was a car that came out from the right, soon as my bf was about to cross the road). I think what affects me the most, is I couldn't do anything to stop the car. All I could do was scream at the top of my lungs. Also, it was hit and run, neither of us were able to get any info. I did call 911 soon as the car stopped long enough for my boyfriend to get away. "

I get drunk often but cause it was New Year\u2019s Eve I got more drunk than I have in a while. But really I think it was mostly because I wanted to forget about my trauma because this is a really tough time of year because it\u2019s supposed to be happy and everyone\u2019s sharing all these \u201cgood memories\u201d and instead of being nostalgic I just feel upset that I can\u2019t go back to being 7 years old again. This morning at like 10 am I went to the shop and brought a big bottle of vodka I\u2019m 17 but I have a fake ID. And the cashier knows me by now because I regularly buy alcohol and vapes from him. And today he gave me the big bottle for the price of the small one which was kind. But I get home at like 11am and by midday I drank like a quater of the bottle. Then I had to go out somewhere with my family. I got back at like 2pm and drank more of it. \n\nThen at like 6 I found out my parents had actually brought me 2 cans of these mixed flavoured vodka things because they wanted me to not over drink I guess. So I drank the those. Then I had two glasses of Prosecco at midnight with my family then when I went back to bed I took a load more shots of vodka. I feel so sick. I\u2019m surprised I haven\u2019t vomited because like I\u2019m still gagging even now. It wasn\u2019t even fun I just can\u2019t stop because I want to forget about the trauma. And I\u2019ve been watching videos of little me on Christmas and new years and it just hurts a lot. Everything was fine back then. I was so happy. And then when I watch videos from when I was 8+ you can see I\u2019m not happy anymore. Because of the trauma. \n\nI\u2019m so suicidal. And I\u2019m embarrassed because I was messing everyone happy new year but I spelled it wrong. Not the most embarrassing drunk text but I\u2019m building it up in my head that everyone hates me. People have hated and physically and sexually and verbally hurt me for small things all my life ig. And I want to be perfect. I want everyone to like me. But no one ever will. \n\nEvery year people are like \u201coh this years gonna be GREAT!\u201d No it\u2019s not. For me anyway. Ever since I was 8 I\u2019ve been permanently depressed because of the rape and abuse and bullying and stuff and it\u2019s just been getting worse and worse every year rather than better."

She mentioned that I might get stomach ache for a couple of weeks but they'll go away. I took my first dose this morning and nothing so far.

She said it so casually like it was no big deal. Like the thigns that happened to me that haunt my sleep and my memories and my dreams every single day could\u2019ve stopped bc she knew and she just didn\u2019t do anything. She chose her own comfort and her own image over my safety. I\u2019ve been having a hard time having a good relationship with her for a plethora of reasons but this is the thing that\u2019s always in the back of my mind. And the craziest thing is that when I told her what happened a year ago she acted surprised like she didn\u2019t know anything and acted completely oblivious just for her to tell me later that she knew and just trusted that he would stop. She saw what was happening with her own eyes and continued to leave me alone with him all day long for years. What can I do? How do I just move on from something like  that? How can I forgive her? \n\nEdit: just so ppl understand my circumstances a little more, I know it\u2019s very unpopular especially on this sub but cutting her off is just not really an option right now. Her mental health is very fragile and she is currently already suffering with suicidal ideation to the point that she is not working and doing therapy full time. I am financially independent from her but all of my younger siblings rely solely on my mom and are pretty much compeltely dependent on her to which if I cut her and she attempted to hurt herself (which I truly think she would do) it would only make things worse for my family. Also culturally, cutting people off is very frowned upon. I\u2019ve cut off my father for what he had done to me but my mom is Asian and it would be an absolutely disgrace to my family to cut her off.\n\nWith all this, I really wanna know what I can do now to cope with this as I will have to be in contact with her. I just don\u2019t wanna feel so haunted by what she\u2019s done everytime we speak. Is there anything I can do to help myself get a bit of a grip on it for the time being at least? And I truly do appreciate any advice or insights on the matter even if you believe i should choose to cut contact. "

She deleted herself 3 months after I left, I guess to make myself feel guilty about leaving her. There\u2019s allot more to the story. My father passed away when I was 7. So here I am at 23 yrs old and trying to figure it out on my own. I have a small family and I have aunts that I love but I\u2019ll never have my mom or that motherly figure. I became a Christian last year and since then I\u2019ve forgiven my mom for everything she did to me, the anger and bitterness and hatred was going to eat me alive. I still am holding her accountable for what she did. But I\u2019m so sad now. I still feel like a little girl that wants her mom to hug her and tell her it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve always wanted that, never got it. And I never will. I\u2019ve never had a father figure either. Things in my life are finally looking up, I have a pretty okay job and I\u2019m saving up for a car, and I just recently got into a relationship with a nice guy. We hope to get married one day and have a family. But I\u2019m just sad because I\u2019ll never have a mom that I can call and ask questions or ask for help. No mom to tell me she\u2019s proud of me and that she loves me. I just miss mami, or at least what she could have been. She looked so happy in photos of me and her when I was little. But she was a narcissist and an evil person and once the good times passed, it was war at home every day. After Jesus it\u2019s become allot easier to deal with day to day, but some days are terrible and I just want to be a little and cry. "

They weren\u2019t really wet dreams but they also kind of were? Like it felt kind of good ig but I also felt so disgusted when I woke up. Recently I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of stuff about urodynamic tests and VCUG and how they can (and often do) cause trauma that presents very similar to rape. I have a lot of symptoms that are consistent with SA but no memory of anything like that actually happening to me as a kid. I also know I did wet the bed a lot as a kid, though idk if it was past the normal age for that kind of stuff. My parents are pretty adamant that I never had any medical procedures done other than ear tubes when I was a toddler. I have no reason to but I have a deep distrust and almost fear of doctors and hospitals in general. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if maybe it\u2019s possible I had some procedure like a VCUG done and my parents just don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth mentioning? Again, I don\u2019t know if this is even the right place to as something like this and I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s not but I just want to stop feeling like I\u2019m crazy when I try to ask them questions about my medical history. If I ask them directly and the answer is no I know they\u2019ll make me feel so stupid for even asking so idk if it\u2019s even worth asking. "

I suffer from complex ptsd, and also have bipolar disorder. I've been abused most of my life from childhood til about few years ago. I have been in counseling 2 years and am on multiple mental health medications. I'm married to a great guy now 40m for the past 5 months ( yes we moved kind of fast) and he has been so supportive of my healing journey. \n\nThe problem is that I don't do well with any kind of disagreement or conflict. I react defensively and definitely go onto fight mode. I will often end up treating my husband like he's the bad guy or my enemy. I can get very cold, distant, I'll be super hard on myself, catastrophize, get really morose, and really negative. I don't mean to or even realize it until it's too late. Him and I have discussed this before , but i dont know how to change. My brain forgets that he's not the enemy and does it all over again. It's like my emotional side takes over and just hijacks me. Does anyone have any advice on ways I can try to get control of this? And is this just my ptsd or is it also the bipolar? I'm maxed out on what I am currently taking but I wonder if it's not enough.

I have been treated by this team for years. I fully trust them. Local anesthesia is not possible. Postponing is not possible anymore - I have been doing that for nearly 2 years. The medical team is being extremely accommodating, a family member that I trust will accompany me until I go under. \n\nI have also been working on this issue with my therapist - simulations, emdr ... everything. Still, surgery is one week away and I'm scared I will run away because I really really need surgery. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?

I don't know if it's a helpful exercise, but occasionally I'll look back on my life (im in my 30s) and try to organize a timeline of all the bullshit. Every time I am overwhelmed by the sheer volume of events I would need to catalogue. Horror, terror, pain, betrayal, etc color so much of my life that I start to get angry. I start to think about how if my life were a novel, it would be called out for being misery porn and the main character that is me would 100% be dragged as a Mary Sue. Incredulity at the gates.\n\nIt stops me from participating in groups, it stops me from speaking my truth, it stops me from letting anyone in. It feels like I have a sign around my neck that says \"I am a one-upper\". I know they say that hurt people seek out more hurt, or at the very least attract people that will hurt them further, but good lord. Gotta think, at what point is it me? What is my share of the blame? After all, i put myself into risky situations because I simply did not care what happened to me. I descended that ladder to the depths, no one else made me.\n\nIt's important for me to put it down in a tangible list, and I suppose I need some level of validation so here it goes:\n\nMom started doing hard drugs when I was 10.\n\nI started drinking at 11, heavily drinking at 13.\n\nMom tries to kill me when I'm 16.\n\nI'm gay. Was outed to my intolerant family when I was 17.\n\nEnlisted as an escape rope. Became a medic.\n\nBegan drinking again in earnest during training. Raped by a colleague, then sexually assaulted by a supervisor.\n\nTransfered to a MASH/CASH. War happened.\n\nI catch my SO cheating, break off the relationship, only to discover the scene of her attempted suicide the next morning.\n\nNo mental health help to be found anywhere. Redoubled my already alarming drinking, blacking out every night as close to my barracks room as I could get. Raped no less than a dozen times.\n\nMany friends die.\n\nI leave the military, start trying to get my shit together. Stay with parents. Mom steals my medication.\n\nNext relationship ends with her saying I'm physically abusive and tells my family and friends I am actively homicidal so I have nowhere to go for help.\n\nTurn to an old friend. He confesses feelings for me. I rebuff his advances. He has a full psychotic break before threatening a mass terrorism event in my name.\n\n\nThese are the big things I can think of off the top of my head. There are 10,000 tinier moments I'm sure I could put down, but all these felt about equal weight.\n\nI feel like people spend their whole lives in therapy for just one of those things. It's hopeless, the work to undo all this damage will never end. And of course, I am always there in the back of my own mind to remind myself:\n\nWho would believe you anyway?\n\n"

    "content": "TW: suicide, guns, police, DV\n\nAdvice also welcome. This will probably be kinda long, hopefully not too confusing. I'm feeling fairly distressed.\n\nI'm a 32 year old widowed single mother. It will be four years in February. My husband killed himself after I told him I wanted a divorce. I still loved him, but I was miserable and had grown afraid of him. He had a lot of his own mental health issues. The end of our relationship was awful. I tried to stop him the night he killed himself. He was really mad and pushed me down in front of our son. My sister was there and I told her to take our son in the spare room when my husband started going for our gun. There was a physical altercation when I tried to take the gun from him. He cut off my air a couple times. When he got away from me he loaded the gun and was screaming at me to get out of his house. I grabbed our coats, shoes, and purses and went and got my sister and my son. She was on the phone with the police. As we went outside, about 15 police cars were pulling up. I gave her the keys and put my son in the car. He was three years old and shaking and told me that he was scared. I told my sister to pull over in a church lot close to our house, so I could give the police a report. We gave our statements and she called my dad to come sit with me so she could take my son to his house to get some sleep. My dad and I sat in the parking lot for eight hours while SWAT tried to talk my husband down. Suicide is illegal in my state and it was a nice neighborhood. We weren't big gun people, but the gun was an old Russian rifle, so he had lot of ammo because of how it came. \n\nNow I've been in a relationship for about a year and a half. I kinda knew I wasn't ready, but I really liked the guy and I thought if I waited until I was ready, I would be waiting forever. I thought I could learn as I went. I was retraumatized when I was arrested for a DUI and again when I went to jail. Now I'm on probation and two months sober. A few months ago I began to feel like I just wasn't ready. Things have gone generally well, but he's wanting to move in together. In the beginning I fantasized about living together and how nice it would be, but I think I was deluding myself. I have a bad habit of taking on the dreams of my romantic partners and convincing myself I'll be happy living the life they want. Now the idea of doing that all again is horrifying to me. I don't want to live with someone else. I need a lot of alone time and I like having my own space. I don't want to have to compromise or feel out of control. I still have a very difficult time saying no. I don't want to have joint accounts or shared bills. I don't want to rely on someone else. I don't want to feel trapped. It doesn't help that my son, who is now seven, doesn't really like my boyfriend that much. My boyfriend does great with him, but they just have clashing personalities. I'm also starting to feel like we don't want the same kind of life. I feel terrible. I know I need to end it. He has been so nice and patient and supportive. I owe him a lot of money which makes me really uncomfortable. I was trying to let him help me, because I'm not good at that, but I feel like I should have said no. Right now I feel like I just want to be alone. I don't have the energy or space to be in a relationship. I'm a shell of who I used to be. Making dinner for a man is triggering. Doing his laundry is triggering. Cleaning for him in general is triggering. Sometimes being told I'm beautiful or sexy is triggering, I went through a hoe period after my husband died and heard things like this from a lot of men, I used to enjoy the complementa but it makes me feel gross now. Like I'm an object, prize, or trophy. Something to be obtained and kept. I need to put everything I have into me and my son. I need the space and freedom to live the life I want. I've felt a little pressure from my father to be in a relationship. He thinks I need to figure out my issues with relationships and that my son needs a father. But my son doesn't have a father. He's gone. And forcing a man on him that he doesn't really like isn't better. \nLately I haven't wanted to see my boyfriend at all. I don't miss him, I dread seeing him. I feel bad that I feel this way, but I can't get around it. I try to be there and be present when we're together. And I enjoy our time while I'm there, but eventually I start getting antsy and I want to go home and when I'm home I feel how wrong it is. I think I understand now why you should wait to have sex in a relationship. It muddles things. It feels like our relationship got ahead of the conversation. I like him, I'm attracted to him, he's sweet, and supportive, and patient, but we have different lifestyles and want different things. I just feel so guilty. I don't know how I let things get so far. I feel like I woke up from a daze. Like I was just going along. I wasn't really present. \n\nThanks if you're still here. \n\nETA since I've been sober a lot of stuff has been coming back up. All the shit I pushed down for years. I miss my husband a lot. I'm grieving him in a way I hadn't before. He was mentally ill, but he was still my best friend and the father of my child. He was angry and controlling, but he got me in a lot of ways that one else ever has. I had a great love, especially in the beginning, before I got pregnant and things got bad. I don't know if I need another one. I want to be the cool aunt with the cool son. I want to put all my energy into making life the best I can for me and my son. We've had such a hard time and we both deserve that. I want to live all the dreams I shelved to be in a romantic relationship. And maybe along the way I'll meet someone who actually wants the same things. But for now, I just want to be alone. I want to feel peace and relationships just don't give me peace. Is it ok if I'm never ready?"

    "content": "Not exactly sure what to title this. It feels like it was yesterday, and it\u2019s just been ringing through my head ever since. This Christmas Eve might have been my worst Christmas. Christmas time has never been good for me. Growing up in an old immigrant family that didn\u2019t believe in mental health problems for women I was locked in the attic or made to walk the streets due to my inability to hear certain noises or I cry. (sensory issues. I am on the spectrum) \nLast year I thought was going to be my worst Christmas. My brother (25M) is a big guy and has a lot of problems. A lot. He attacked my veteran father in front of my grandmother at her home and then blew up screaming, running out of the house. She was sobbing frantically, in the beginning stages of dementia. She passed in October, that was her last Christmas. My mom had left to go home when I was home with a friend in the garage. She texted me to get inside immediately, afraid my brother was going to come back and try to kill us because of previous incidents he has done so. We were fearing for our lives, my dad waiting at a nearby bar to try to catch him walking by since it was a very long walk. He wasn\u2019t wearing shoes or even a coat and since it was winter and freezing some people called the cops. That stopped him from hurting us. \n\nBack to the present\n\nThis Christmas Eve was\u2026I don\u2019t know how to even explain. My brother has been destroying our house and aggressive to all of us, shoving us, eating all of our food (holiday and not) won\u2019t let us in the kitchen or he becomes aggressive, ect. He\u2019s unemployed because he can\u2019t keep a job and he\u2019s a few months sober from substances after he had a massive overdose in September and had multiple seizures so he can\u2019t drive either. He\u2019s made our lives a living hell in so many ways I don\u2019t have room to type. He can be so kind, but yet he can be so cruel. His personality flips instantly and he can become hostile. \n\nWe were driving in the car on the way to church for Christmas Eve at 11pm. I was sick and had just gotten off a long shift at work but I was bearing through it because it was the only thing my dad asked of us. Not even a few minutes in and my brother who was next to me was beginning to flick and prod me painfully, trying to provoke me. He suddenly began to spew all of this hateful stuff, cussing me out and then hitting my leg. I can\u2019t even remember what was happening but he has these moments of delusion and violence. He was saying something about how he was the happiest person in the family (he is severely depressed and aggressive and is never happy, and makes all of us live in fear) and I finally had enough. I told him that he was not happy, because he was mean to us constantly. There was a pause, I thought he\u2019d be quiet from there. Without warning he struck me multiple times, as hard as he possibly could. I screamed, and the car stopped immediately as both of my parents began to break down. My dad was about to cry, yelling \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore. Why (brother name), why?!\u201d And my mom was crying and begging him to stop. Everybody jumped out of the car at once. I was frozen on the road as my dad ran to my brother making sure he wasn\u2019t going to hurt me anymore and my brother ran up to my dad and was holding onto his arm. My mom took the car and had to coax me and nudge me in because I was frozen. I just started sobbing from there. \n\nThis is summarized as short as I possibly can with context, but I now have massive bruises all over my body. Massive. They hurt. They\u2019re ugly. They\u2019re still dark purple now and turning ugly yellow. He\u2019s hurt me a lot in my life but it hasn\u2019t been this bad in a long, long time. Customers were staring at me at my job the other day. Some of them whispering about the bruises. That was just my arm, but they didn\u2019t even see my leg. It\u2019s so embarrassing and I want to curl away. I\u2019m 21F. He is 25M. He is so much bigger than me, twice my literal height and weight. I kept telling myself it wasn\u2019t that bad until the next morning I saw how large the bruises were, and how many there were. \n\nSorry for how long this is. It\u2019s going through my mind so much and I\u2019ve been going through so many emotions. I\u2019ve been leaving my room to work, but I\u2019ve just been sleeping so much more now. Staying in my room. My parents bought him an apartment for Christmas because of how violent he has been to everybody. Then Christmas Eve happened. He\u2019s caused my dad\u2019s health to deteriorate, his hair instantly greying over the course of a year. The doctor says that he is at high risk of a heart attack over everything my brother is putting my dad through. None of us can take it anymore. \n\nEver since then he\u2019s been so mean. Shoving us, cruel, I stay away as much as I can. "

Only when I'm well and truly about to keel over do I trudge into bed.  Or if my wife drags me there by the ear (and not in the fun way).\n\nWhich has left me with a theory.

This compounded with being a single mom with full custody, at times I feel like I\u2019m drowning and unable to be the best parent I can be.   \n\nI have noticed that my anger skyrockets now when I\u2019m faced with anything triggering.  My boyfriend recently lied to me in a way that felt like a huge betrayal, but my reaction was so massive that it almost overshadowed my boyfriend\u2019s betrayal.  I said horrible things that I regret, and I can see so clearly that I am permanently stuck in fight or flight.   I want to get out of it.   This is just one of several examples where I have disproportionally lost my cool when exposed to a trigger.  \n\nI\u2019m looking for others who have dealt with anger with PTSD, being stuck in fight/flight,  and what worked for them to move past it.  I feel so stuck.   This is not who I am.  I miss the old me.   "

    "content": "My wife, S, works for the local animal shelter as a behavior tech. She works with dogs who need and deserve a little extra love. One such dog was languishing away in the shelter and on a quality of life euthanasia list, so we brought her home for a few days. \n\nOn the morning of the 26th, the dog saw one of our cats (who we had been keeping separate for their safety- as we didn\u2019t know how the dog would react to the cats) and hoped the gate we have that separates our bedrooms from the rest of the house. She bolted for the cat- my wife\u2019s soul cat. S ran after the dog, and through some very quick thinking, S got the dog to let go of the cat\u2019s leg and Crusty-said soul cat- got away clean. My wife wasn\u2019t so lucky. The dog turned and latched on to her arm and wouldn\u2019t let go. I relive those agonizing minutes while we both struggled to get the dog\u2019s mouth open, over and over. I got the dog off of her and into the bathroom, where I shut the door. My wife\u2019s arm had suffered extensive damage from the biting. Cue an ambulance, animal control, and all manner of amazing friends who came to \u201ccrime scene\u201d clean our house. \n\nI am so beyond grateful that the ultimate cost was ~100 stitches. No lasting or significant muscle damage, no nerve or tendon damage. I should be so grateful. But I\u2019m still so scared. If there\u2019s not noise around me, the sounds of get screaming ring in my ears, the smell of her blood and fear-sweat and the dog\u2019s saliva is still in my nose. And there\u2019s still blood on the wall that paint hasn\u2019t been able to fully cover. \n\nWhat do I do? How do I make it stop? I\u2019m mourning the normalcy we lost, the safety I felt in my own home, my peace of mind. Anything, anything at all would help. "

    "content": "Hey everybody, it's the overly-intense librarian, back at it with our monthly updates. Reminder that this is\u00a0*not*\u00a0a bot post, it was written by me, an actual human, over the span of this month.\n\nAs per the routine, please check out our\u00a0[Community Notices](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/wiki/notices/)\u00a0page for updates from the previous month. We've also got the\u00a0[Creator Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/wiki/creators/)\u00a0for our subreddit artists, let us know if you want in- or just check out what we already have up!\n\n# Research\n\nSomewhat tangential, *but* I do have something I want to address. I have been informed that a number of people *on* the Writer's Wiki had deleted their accounts / gone inactive, so we're down a few folks. It's looking pretty slim in there. If you would like to [join the list](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/schizophrenia&subject=Join+the+Writer%27s+Wiki), let us know! It's not *just* for writers, the primary use is for undergraduate researchers, students, or journalists conducting interviews that may not meet our criteria for inclusion on the subreddit publicly.\n\n**Currently active studies for the last month:**\n\n* From the clever folks at Oxford (who know all there is to be known), we have\u00a0[Social Identity in Voice Hearers](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1h211sh/mod_approved_hearing_voices_and_identity_study/). \\[UK Only\\]\n* From Lancaster University, our friend Katie is doing a 'final push' for participants in a study regarding\u00a0[Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1hgeczt/uk_early_intervention_in_psychosis_research/).

You may have seen our new disclaimer update for Selfie Sundays... essentially, a selfie is\u00a0*not*\u00a0an invitation for DMs. If the OP is open to DMs, they're free to indicate as such in the comments.\n\nWe've had to take action against a few people now, but thankfully nothing too terribly much. Overall, I'm relatively pleased with how it has been going. To reiterate- if someone wants to say something on Selfie Sunday, they can say it in front of the whole class.\n\nDon't make it weird.\n\n# Rule 11 - Private Community Invites\n\nReddit has still not squished the cockroach mentioned in our [Community Notices](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/wiki/notices/problemgroups/#wiki_crazy_nice_people_.28discord.29) page. We have at this point over 100 different testimonies, accounts, links to evidence, or other such material up for review. It seems the admins have had their plates quite full recently, and have been clearing the backlog. We've waited 8 months thus far, so what's waiting a couple more?\n\nAgain, this group primarily uses r/schizophrenia, r/schizoaffective, and r/psychosis as their hunting grounds. We do believe there may be others, but that is merely speculation at this point. If you get an invite to a private community that makes you feel uneasy or suspicious, please let us know via [Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/schizophrenia) and we can file it accordingly... because at the end of the day, we're glorified bureaucrats, volunteer internet janitors.\n\nIf you receive an invite and feel that these individuals singling you out is \"harassment,\" please utilize Reddit's report function accordingly (along with the 'block' function). It is strongly advised to not engage with these people.\n\n# Living Well After Schizophrenia\n\nThis seems to be a topic with continual updates.\n\nRecent events have shown us that apparently, the team at LWAS (namely, Rob and Lauren) perceive *any* type of criticism- no matter how polite and constructive- to be personal attacks and intolerable. Here I was scratching my head about all of this \"hate\" she had been going on about on the channel, I guess \"evidence-based criticisms\" = \"hate\" in the fantasy land of LWAS.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems our efforts in curbing this \"hate\" have been in vain, because under absolutely no fucking circumstances I am going to discourage people from speaking up against what they seem to broadly perceive as recklessness and being irresponsible. This is Reddit, and arguing with nerds is what you *do* on Reddit. If you can't stand criticism, maybe you shouldn't be reading Reddit. Keto-friendly food for thought there, Lauren.\n\nDespite our many attempts to reach some type of satisfactory resolution, every single one has thus far been ignored. I believe we are at lucky number 7 now, and I think it's long past time that we reciprocated the treatment we have been shown and treat the Keto arc on LWAS with the seriousness it deserves; none. I've had a few people here refer to this situation as \"drama,\" and honestly, that really resonates with me. I like that, it really illustrates how completely unserious the entire situation is. \n\nThe type of conduct we have received and also seen shown to others is not consistent with that of a serious person. It is deeply disappointing in a number of regards to see such conduct from someone who presents themselves as a mental health advocate, even if just through a vlog. I've honestly never been on the receiving end of or witnessed such disrespect directed towards others with some modicum of professionalism in the mental health spheres.\n\n**Moving forward,** we are lifting Rule 1 protections regarding LWAS. Lauren will be extended no further grace than any other member of the subreddit. I think they might do with a nice, blunt wake-up call for what their own kind *really* think about this behavior in general (or specifically). So long as you don't use overt insults- it's fair game now. Also, no brigading or anything like that... Reddit rules are still in effect.\n\nI offer my apologies to the community for not holding true to our values of \"keeping shit real\" for the sake of 'being gracious.' We will not be repeating that mistake.\n\nSo enjoy any future LWAS \"drama,\" now with no more padded corners.\n\n# Community Feedback\n\nNow, for my favorite part- let's hear from you! Still haven't any requests on special flairs regarding\u00a0[data scraping](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1eyfc9k/poll_results_data_scraping/)\\- but if you want one, drop a comment and I'll make it happen.\n\nAny other random questions/comments/concerns that have popped into your head over the last month you'd like us to answer, feel free to let us know what you think. You've got our full attention.\n\nTake care, everybody!"

    "title": "We're Jumping on the Twitter/X Ban Train",
    "content": "As it should come as no surprise to literally anybody, we're not a huge fan of the #1 pusher of microchip-in-the-brain, 'totally normal extended arm at a 45 degree angle with flat palm turned downwards gesture' (x2), AfD fanboy, cheats at PoE2, runs a literal meme department of the government with our tax dollars... so on and so forth.\n\nLong story short, fuck Elon Musk- for a number of things.\n\nWe are officially banning links to Twitter/X as a result. Some places are making this about fascism or something, which I guess is *partially* true here, but even more than that- he sucks. He just *really* sucks, and his platform sucks too.\n\nHonestly, considering what this community is *about,* pushing a chip in the brain is probably more pertinent than doing the salute.\n\n# What's different?\n\nWell, next to nothing. Rule 13 (Misinformation) usually catches content from Twitter/X or the various facets of Meta's enterprises. Links to Twitter or FB/IG are fairly rare around here already... like, exceedingly rare. So now we're just kind of trimming the fat to make our jobs easier.\n\n# This seems like a stunt.\n\nOh, it totally is. 100%. This is a gag and completely for yuks, and if it weren't easy as cake to implement (the Automod code is so simple even I can do it) then we wouldn't be doing it.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's not much more than another tally on the list of subreddits shutting it down. Maybe some people might think it's funny that our primary reason is a bit 'different' than most subreddits. There is no bigger purpose or crusade here aside from some cheap yuks.\n\nMost of what comes off of X/Twitter related to psychosis is utter trash anyways, so this is more of just driving home the point with finality. Our overarching mission here is to keep shit real... and whatever's going on over there departed from 'real' quite some time ago. Might as well cut the cord for good.\n\n# You don't seem to be taking this seriously.\n\nWe're unpaid internet janitors. I act my wage. I am the epitome of professionalism when I am actually getting paid to do that, but that is not the case here. If you want professionalism and seriousness, I take tips on CashApp.\n\nThis whole broader situation is frankly terrifying. The least we can do is make jokes and laugh about it, because the alternative is just freaking out and/or crying because things are *not* okay here in the US.\n\nSo, hopefully this has been validating- and if not, at least funny. If neither of those are true... well, sorry for wasting your time.\n\nWhatever criticisms can be made of us here, there's one thing you can never say- we aren't fake, and when we say our mission is \"keeping shit real,\" we are 100% dedicated to that and follow through.\n\nTake care, everybody... and keep it real."

    "title": "Is my mother an undiagnosed paranoid schizophrenic?? ( pics included)",
    "content": "everyone please take this was a grain of salt, I\u2019m not a medical professional is this is why I\u2019m seeking help from a place that might know how to help. I officially reached my peak, I\u2019ve spent years ignoring it and but it\u2019s gotten worse since I recently turned 16\n\nfor some background context, my mother grew up an orphan adopted by her aunt, allegedly her aunt stole her from her mom and she didn\u2019t know her dad until she did a dna test abt 6 - 7 years ago. my mother went through major trauma and abuse from her aunt during her growing years. at the age of 17 she got pregnant and went through a 20-ish yr long abusive marriage w my biological father which I had only met a few times. she later went through 2 other mentally and physically abusive relationships which I had experienced with her. I\u2019m telling you this because a lot of these are the starting of the stories she tells me and my belief on why maybe the paranoia started.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how to sum up these last few years in a paragraph but I\u2019ll try my best. In 2019 i think is when she started talking about her past a lot, i didn\u2019t think of much then because i was really young and she never consulted me about it, if there were major changes in her attitude i didn\u2019t notice until a few years later. She also suddenly started mentioning how all her devices were hacked, and how my biological father hacked it, but again for some reason nothing too alarming for me. \n\nIn January 2022 a few days after my birthday she started getting into heavy arguments with my step-dad, she mainly and randomly started accusing him of having a recording device in his contact lenses and that he was conspiring against her with her family she has bad blood with. this accusation mainly came out of no where and when I asked her her reply was she js \u201cknew\u201d. in result of this she started shoving cameras in his face and live streaming him to Facebook claiming he was conspiring with her family and the government to spy on her. this ended in a physical altercation, making the police come over and not allowing my step dad into the premises of the house. \n\nMind you, me and my mother moved to an entire state in the middle of the country where we had no family or friends around. when he left he took the car. there weren\u2019t any Ubers of Lyfts around because I lived in a extremely ghosted, small town in Michigan. In result we spent a total of 5 MONTHS without leaving the house or anyone checking up on us. We had to order groceries online. my mother switched up her conclusion of her husband not even a hour after he was put into jail saying that \u201che was trying to protect us\u201d and 2022 yr old me was still convinced my mom was right. the house was raided and everything was broken and out of place. My room had an attic, and my mother full heartedly believed a grown man was living in our attic. She broke her body mirror placing shard of glass in case a man tried to climb out ( pictures provided) \n\nmy mother in these 5 months convinced me someone was spraying sweet smelling gas through our vents to try and hurt us. she told me the government was directing radiation waves directly towards her. In this time she called the police and the fbi multiple times trying to tell them that\u2019s she was experiencing something called gangstalking. I have full 30 minutes recordings of these conversations.\na very constant belief she had during this isolation was my father and my older sister (???) was hacking her phone and listening to her conversations. my mom and older sister don\u2019t have a great relationship ( this comes to play later ) she also was covering smoke detectors and outlets because she thought there were cameras in there. \n( pics provided ) \n\nwe ended up getting evicted in May so we got our step dad to get our stuff in a U-Haul and tried moving to Atlanta without any money or a plan. We hopped to hotel to hotel, and while we were out my mom was telling me there were cars following our U-Haul or people in stores following us. ( picture taken, blurred the poor women\u2019s face for privacy but she \u201ctoke\u201d a photo of me randomly in a store and later explained there were people stalking us in the background, needing it for proof) Again her belief was that her family were gangstalking her. we had no where to go and was running out of money. My older sister despite her bad relationship with my mom offered us a place at her house a state over. so we ended up traveling to the state we are at now.  \n\nwe stayed there to spring to fall and the entire time my mother terrorized my sister\u2019s husband claiming he was the one also behind her phone\u2019s hacking and that he was drugging my sister unconscious?? she believed the government put her husband in her life to manipulate her. we later got kicked out and moved into my brothers room which didn\u2019t last for long cause we got kicked out then too.\nwe had to move to a shelter and ended up getting a house 3 months later with financial aid.\n\nso 2-3 years later, if you\u2019re wondering. my mom still has the same beliefs. she still believes everything is hacked. she told me she believes she able to move the clouds. she thinks that her family works in the government and planned out her whole life to go a certain way. she believes EVERYONE was planted in her life. she bought a camera detector off of Amazon thinking there are cameras in the house. \n\nI don\u2019t just hear this a few times a month. I hear it EVERYDAYY and every conversation she starts with someone. im not exaggerating when I say it\u2019s the ONLY thing she talks about. I avoid her constantly because she can\u2019t stop talking about it. and yes people have noticed, my brother who is still in contact with my mom noticed. Multiple police officers have asked if she was sane. she is extremely isolated, she talks with no family or no friends. I mean she only talks to me and my brother. \n\nnow, yes I\u2019ve tried talking to her about it and she doesn\u2019t believe me one bit and believes I\u2019m manipulated and don\u2019t want to see the truth. she says it\u2019s impossible for her to develop schizophrenia because the doctor she consulted years ago said she was mentally strong enough for it not the develop. I\u2019m isolated because of this, it affects me and my mental health. and since I\u2019ve turned 16 she\u2019s increased the frequency of how many times she talks about it because she wants to \u201cwarn\u201d me. I\u2019m so sick of this, this isn\u2019t the same mom I remember when I was a child, I can\u2019t convince her and I need guidance of some sort. \n\nsorry for the typos and errors, reddit won\u2019t let me go back and correct them.

    "content": "I just had the most terrifying and surreal experience I've ever had in my 33 years alive. I can't disclose everything that happened because I was threatened in another reality and if I discuss certain details I will get taken back there and most likely kept there. So...I laid down in bed an hour or two ago because I got overwhelmingly tired when I shouldn't have been since I woke up at 1 this afternoon. Let's just say my brain started pulsing which happens every time I'm getting spiritually attacked.I kept nodding off and my vision started to double and before I knew it I was completely paralyzed. \n\nI saw some things that were scary and strange that I can't talk about. Let's just say that I have my own proof that Schizophrenia is NOT the brain simply going haywire or playing tricks on us. There are people and entities in other realities messing with us and they can take us to these other realities whenever they feel like it. Like I said ....I saw some things in my room including a person behaving weird, having one of my old songs played back where I was growling lyrics and then the voice said \"You know what Daddy's gonna do?\" \n\nThen while in paralysis I felt my body get heavy and something else that I can't explain because they don't want me to.I felt my soul vibrating or speeding up as I was being prepared to be taken to another reality.I started seeing a circular aura of light burst two or three times before I went to this other reality. Also a wide and thick column of grey smoke like material formed like a vortex from the top of my ceiling down to where I was lying down.When I got to this other reality what I saw there were other people who appeared human...or maybe they were posing as humans. \n\nThere were five of them sitting in a circle in some room and they knew everything about me.I was a little scared and had my head down and one of them told me that he wants me to look at him. I couldn't even lift my head up to see what they looked like except the dude on my left.The one to my left had a giant dark red almost black mask on that was bigger than his face with spikes coming out of it ....or at least it appeared to be a mask.I asked them if I could go home and they said \"Ah man, ....just when we were getting some good company\". \n\nBefore I was taken to that other reality there was definitely someone standing over me from behind with giant arms but I couldn't make the figure out and then I said \" I knew I was gonna go to Hell ....I just knew it.\" Then I asked if I was going to be returned home and one of them said \"Don't worry, we got you covered\". This all happened right after I got done watching porn....so they clearly are twisted beings that actually want me to stay off of porn and they mess with me to scare me into doing the right thing. Well I can tell you that after that experience....I am never going on porn ever again. \n\nI guess there has to be some kind of Creator out there in the cosmos because evidently these beings I met exist as well as the voice.There's beings in my room that I can only see when they want me to see them. They told me that they watch me.The question is ....if there's a creator and it is benevolent, ...why didn't he stop them from taking me to another reality? Why did he allow them to do something to me that I can't discuss? A scarier thought is that maybe there is no creator. Maybe there's just evil beings from other realms and our Universe is one gigantic black abyss and we are in what you would call Hell."

He ended up being emotionally unresponsive. \n\nHe talked about moving his therapy journey into trauma specifically. I even looked up a couple of places and suggested that he send them a message to ask for availability - knowing that it takes forever to get a possible appointment, because our country's healthcare system is not the fastest. \n\nHe kept brushing off my help.

How do you make it work with a partner?\n\nI wrote most of this over several days, and picked it up today, when she broke up with me. Since im 'too ill'. \nSo i guess its a solo life for the rest then. \n\n\nIt seems very difficult for many of us who have a SZ related diagnosis, to actually function with a partner. If that partner is not extremely understanding. And able to cope with the Paranoia, the delusions, and up/down mood. And rest of the crap cooking in our heads. \n\n\nI have seen this woman for some time(5'ish months), thats 4 months more than anyone else in the past what, 8-10years. Iv spent most of my time alone. Some time with friends, and volunteer at the local Mental Health institution. \n\nI swear that this woman i have been seeing has a good heart. And is a good influence in the world. Much better than me. She has taken an education, despite being a foreigner. She is resourceful and smart.\nBut she as anyone else also has her burdens to carry. She have had a tough upbringing, and some very bad experiences.\n\nShe has been a very positive influence, to my life, in many many ways.\n\nBut. I have my problems. I try to tell her some of them, so that i can get them off my chest, so that she knows that this crap is actually cooking in my head. But its hard for her. And i frequently just 'shut down/flatline/stress out' whatever, when we misunderstand one another. \n\nIf we have a misunderstanding, i smell worse in just an afternoon sitting with mental chaos, than a week without a shower. Its insane. I dont get it. Constant sweat from my armpits. And its a quite harsh smell.\n\nI dont run away to a screen, to stop thinking, or avoid conversation, except if i get a message from someone i know, or my kids. \nI try to read something, either on my kindle, or in paper format. And i use a marker for interesting bits. Not that i remember them anyways. I knit. I draw. I use nicotine(vape) and coffee. Because she has asthma, i open a window or door and blow out the smoke when im with her. And we have been together A LOT. \n\nSo i try to be open. Tell her some of what is happening and not happening inside of me. \nAnd we are still barely scratching the surface. She is finding it very difficult to cope with how 'broken' i am. \n\nI dont tell her that i suspect she is sent out to monitor me, iv had that in my head for 5 months. To check on me. That she spies on me. That she puts things in places to see how i react. Drops stuff on the floor. And that I think that she tricks me with words sometimes. And that she jokes about my memory. I dont tell her about the delusions/or not, that there are cameras monitoring around. That people are watching. How nothing is a coincidence. Like everything that happens is meant to happen. \n\nStill, while keeping most under the lid. Just waiting for it to pass. Go away. \nI still scare her off. She thinks i dont care. I do. But i mean, what the hell of what goes on in my head, should i even pay attention to. \nI just dont trust my own judgment or perception.\n\nIv made many improvements in regards to physical health. And food.\nHave lots of pains, cant sit without support pillows anywhere cause of my back. In the evening sometimes i cant even hold my Kindle to read, because of the pains in my wrists/hands. \nBut i do simple workouts. Routinely. Every day. And gradually have become physically more fit. \nBut it does not carry over to my mental health. \n\nI eat healthy, sometimes some snacks. I take my meds in the evening. I dont drink. I dont smoke. I shower. I shave. I cut my hair. Change underwear and socks. I clean. I vacuum. Wash my clothes. \nI try to incorporate what I hear, into improving on myself. To become somewhat better. Or as good as i can, with this nightmare inside.\n\n\nIm on the verge of just giving up the relationship thou. I cant be there in the way that i should be. In the way that a partner should. And im afraid that i am wasting her time. \nShe has also told me i am asexual. Which is probably very true. Also i forget things. A lot. And i become uncertain/confused.\nI also struggle with not noticing things, like other peoples bodily appearance. Social hints and queues. I dont notice if something is 'unusual', if someone is pregnant(unless its extremely obvious). Or like a week ago, a man i met a few years ago on the Mental Health Institution, last week i noticed for the first time, that his left arm was amputated in the middle between the elbow and wrist. If someone gains 10-20kg, i dont really notice that either. Its been like this all my life. Change in haircut. Change in haircolor. Change of clothing. \n\nIv told her that i have applied for a new therapist. And I have, but its probably not going to help, again. Its just going to be another therapist that i cant talk to. Iv tried all the meds i can. \n\nI am on 'medical benefits', or whatever its called when you are sick, and the Goverment supports me so that I dont live on the street. \nI have a Guardian in regards to Finances. And to make sure that i dont just make bad decisions and give everything i have away on a whim. \n\n"

Problem is I have Schizophrenia, and it is very hard to do all of this alone. I just got out of a controlling relationship as well, and I am recovering from that emotionally at this time.\n\nIt is winter, I was dumped in the fall and trying to piece my life back together since. I am realizing how strong my schizophrenia symptoms are when I am alone. I have been struggling a lot during this time, while also trying to get my life back together. Living in the city that I do, it is very hard to secure a good and stable job in ample time. During this time of me getting my bearings and struggling through it, I have reached out to my parents for direct support, almost like being my sponsor, and my Dad agreed to help me through all of this adulting process. He is helping me pay rent and find a job and get myself back on track to be functional. \n\nMy Dad has Afib which means any bit of stress makes his heart rate go up. I have an anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, and depressive episodes. My symptoms have been making his heart rate go up, he gets upset at me easily I feel because he is so burnt out from me over the years. I blew up on my Mom the other day because she is not understanding of me at all. I do not want to lose myself to this illness. I really don't. I take an antipsychotic, Abilify, and I am getting my dose upped in the spring. \n\nI feel so guilty that I am making my Dad have heart problems, and my Mom is dealing with emotions from me from all the trauma I have caused. I just sleep a lot because I cannot deal with the guilt. It makes my life feel pointless. I really can see that I am burdening my parents, they never asked for a child like this and they make sure to let me know they feel that way. \n\nI just want to have a calm job that pays my bills and I can stop stressing my parents out.

    "title": "Does anyone know how to remediate dopamine damage in the brain from a psychotic episode?",
    "content": "Hello guys,\n\nI haven't used reddit for a while, and I wanted to give it a shot. I had an episode during 2021 during lockdowns in university in my second year of studies while trying to get into medschool. I got trolled by my friends into taking several hard courses which ended up bringing my stress levels to completely record highs. The doctor said my episode was brought on by extreme stress and I used no drugs to cause it whatsoever. I have been able to heal from the episode quite a bit, like being able to get off my meds, getting approved from the psychiatrist to go to school etc., but one problem still remains, which is that the damage the episode left over is still not healed. As a result, I cannot study or go to work because my mental capacity is still severely weakened.\n\nAt the height of the episode, I remember there was a \"neurochemical leak\" of some sort from dopamine go around my brain. Since then, its been really difficult to function on a normal basis, because taking care of myself, reading and studying has become very difficult. I feel as though there are \"tracks\" the dopamine surge left over in my brain that on occasion seal back together, but happens very slowly and very unpredictably. I have been trying to get rid of the damage the episode did, but no one seems to know how to help me. My psychiatrist tells me \"you can't feel your brain.\" And my naturopathic doctor tells me he has never heard such a thing.\n\nI have discovered a few ways of remediating the damage. Attending university lectures helps ( I even started crashing some new ones to further the healing process), rushing through my university school work at shorter time intervals works, video games in small doses helps a bit too. Also, a job that involves a lot of concentration (i.e. lifeguarding) seems to help a bit as well. So far, lots of damage remains, and I'm running out of options because its been four years (two of which I spend recovering) and the damage from the episode is preventing me from going back to school. I'm stuck in an in between zone, where Im not fully sick and not healed either. I'm also reliant on my dad's income, which is really bad. \n\n**Does anyone know a way to remediate this sort of damage the psychotic episode did?**\u00a0The only recommendation I got from the psychiatrist was go back to school or work , which is a really bad recommendation since it comes at the expense of reducing my GPA (I got two C's this way, in an otherwise straight A report card) and its costing me a ridiculous amount of money.\u00a0**I will be very thankful to someone if they know any activities I can do at home or in school which could help me get rid of all the damage from the episode so I can go back to school like I was doing before.**\n\nP.S. I literally feel parts of my brain seal up every once in a while, and I noticed my right vision clear while that was happening. Does anyone have the same experience?\n\nThank you."

    "title": "LSD fucked me up big time. I need help.",
    "content": "I was taking LSD (a psychedelic) every other day for maybe four to five months during 2021. I had grown comfortable taking it because I always prided myself for having \u201ccontrol\u201d over it whereas my friends, who would occasionally have bad trips taking it, were sensitive towards the drug. \n\nFor context, and this is important, I had been smoking weed since the early age of 13 and did a lot of MDMA when I was 17. When my Mom had passed away, I decided to sober up and turn my life around, which I did. \n\nMy story was so inspiring, friends and people I did not know thought that I was going to be the next President, which I believed, considering how passionate I was about politics and helping people out. Anyways, this streak of sobriety lasted for maybe a year and a half. And when I entered college, began smoking weed again due to the excitement of being introduced to a culture that I believed I could easily adapt to \n\nThis is when the story gets interesting, and maybe even the cause of my downfall. \n\nI had met a pretty girl in my class. Let\u2019s just say that I grew to become obsessed over her, and although she already expressed rejection and discomfort towards me (as I would constantly like her posts on social media, and due to my reputation during the time, would insinuate, at least according to her, that there was something going on between us), I took it as a sign of motivation to keep on going for her and not accept being rejected. \n\nAnyways, after that, she blocked me on Facebook. \nFast forward to 2021, I was doing a lot of LSD like how I introduced at the start of this post. For some reason, it hit me really hard, like really really hard. \n\nI developed intense grandiose thoughts of me actually believing I could be the President, other than me believing I was the living reincarnation of Jesus Christ. For me, it didn\u2019t matter what other people thought, because I believed what I believed in regardless of what others thought, even my family. I had dwelled into the compliments and admiration of my peers due to past accolades that I didn\u2019t get to understand anymore that that wasn\u2019t the case, as my behavior, attitude, and mentality totally changed when I had developed these grandiose thoughts. \n\nMore than this, I began exhibiting odd behaviors. I was talking to myself, listening to music constantly (I would put my phone speaker beside my ear) which my family and friends found weird because were earphones for, right? And I would walk around in the middle of the night at my home doing this off behavior. \n\nAnyways, every time I would see the girl on social media in a mutual friend\u2019s account, I would believe that these mutual friends were \u201cteasing\u201d me to like her. In my mind, I believed that she was orchestrating all these hang outs with our mutual friends to tease me, which of course wasn\u2019t the case. These \u201chang outs\u201d would happen probably for 4-5 months. And the grandiose thoughts didn\u2019t stop. \n\nIt got worse during the first quarter of 2022. \n\nI had begun posting these odd political related posts on my social media and people noticed that it wasn\u2019t me (I used to be very sharp and acute when it came to my political positions but these were just plain emotional and stupid). In my mind, I would fantasize that she was going to be my wife and the First Lady. It reached a point that everything I would see on social media I would think would be directed towards me (I would formulate a reasoning behind what people would be posting about). \n\nMy schizophrenia at this point reached its peak. I began messaging her friends, even her ex, about how I was so obsessed with her and if I could visit her at her home. I even brought my siblings to watch her brother\u2019s concert where her whole family was present (it was so fuckin weird and awkward I dont know why I did that). \n\nAnyways, things began to stop when I got to talk to my family about my behavior, we didn\u2019t talk about the girl, but we talked about these odd behaviors that they were noticing and I was able to quit it out. I had learned that when busy, I tend to stray away from these grandiose thoughts and odd behaviors. \n\nFast forward to 2024. I had still been smoking a lot of weed, but took LSD again during the first quarter of 2024. After maybe three years. \n\nThe schizophrenia hit again. This time it was much worse. \n\nI created a social media account, stealing photos of my friends, her and her family, even people I don\u2019t know personally but were close to her, and I would post these political captions that would correlate to my delusional thoughts of me and her being together, it was schizophrenia and delusion at its finest. She and her family wanted to report me to the police. But because my sister talked to her, and my Dad talked to her Mother, they realized that it was a mental condition and did not want to burden my family\u2019s situation with what was happening to me. \n\nI went to therapy, and decided to quit drugs forever (a really big step in my opinion, considering how my older 27 year old brother does a lot of drugs too). I believe I\u2019ve reached a very low point in my life because of these experiences. I find a hard time forgiving myself, and accepting this. Who I am now is very different from who I was before in probably all aspects of life possible. \n\nI need help. "

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share something that's been really helpful for me lately. I\u2019ve always been a perfectionist and never felt I had raw talent in creative areas, so I never really engaged much in artistic activities. However, recently I\u2019ve realized just how important creative outlets can be for managing my mental health, especially with the help of AI tools like MidJourney and Suno.\n\nSince discovering AI-driven platforms, I\u2019ve dived into creativity in a way I hadn\u2019t before. One of the most impactful things I\u2019ve done recently is create songs with Suno. The lyrics have a lot of personal meaning to me, and I\u2019ve found that listening to them when I\u2019m feeling a bit unstable really helps to recenter myself.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like words alone can\u2019t fully express what we\u2019re experiencing at times, but through AI, I can channel those feelings into something creative and therapeutic. It\u2019s been a game-changer in helping me stay grounded.\n\nIf anyone else here has used AI for creative outlets or has found art in general to be helpful, I\u2019d love to hear about your experiences!"

I keep asking for more medication and they say no almost everytime. I will ask again later this week with the psychiatrist as i have been transferred to a new clinic.

Fast forward and we made up because it was a petty fight and I once again handled it awful. Now time skip she's in college and I have a newborn. We would only hangout if I asked her to. She would never reach out to me. And sometimes would let comments slip that she was embarrassed that her only friend was 3 years younger than her. I was hurt but didn't pay much mind to it. We talked about it and she told me she was just busy with school and work.

Now that I  have my family back we have gone back to not hanging out unless I ask her to. This has caused me to feel extremely unwanted.

She didn't respond and left me on read. Mind you we are neighbors ;----; so this makes it incredibly hard to just not hang out ;---;  she also wrote an essay about me in college and my schizophrenia but didn't let me read it ;-,-; maybe all these things are minor, maybe I'm expecting too much.

It is nothing but *ancedotal evidence* i.e. pseudoscience that has a firm root in the Critical Psychiatry (anti-psychiatry)modern day movement.\n\nThis motivated me to start searching on the subject and some of their history is alarming and frankly terrifying; (CCHR & Church of Scientology) perhaps should come with a Trigger Warning for some? \n\nBringing the subject further to the front, as it branches out and relates to this particular network: Dr. Chris Palmer, Dr. Josef,  Dr. Scher, Dr. Berg just to name a few, all use the same method of peddling their \"practice\" *hyper - sensationalizing* using the same visual methods of tabloid style,  digital \"art\", eye catching/clicking baiting icons/backgrounds. It is a way Advertising.\nThat is all they use YouTube for, they are medical influencers and NONE of them have gone through the vetting process to get an Authentication Badge. \n\nDr. Berg is not a doctor but a chiropractor. And his son came out with a public critique of him being with the Church of Scientology.\n\nFurther digging revealed that the CEO of Roblox is the founder of Metobolic Minds. Their son has made a \"Cure\" claim, as well, regarding keto and bipolar. (The Baszucki Group)\n\nPushing further, The Baszucki Foundation has invested in a huge AI related project in Computational Psychiatry. *Neuroblox*\n\nNevermind, that Roblox is undergoing a class action lawsuit involving children, gaming addiction and child labor. Nor the freakish child sex predators platform, that has gained attention there and the most recent report finding a connection of childhood gaming and brain injury.\n\nAre these networks attempting to change the world of psychiatry and medicine, as we know it,  through data gathering - illegal? - inside private \"peer groups\", etc.  (all of our online sharing about our illness and experiences) and plugging all of that into AI  Neuroblox thru the computer software program they have developed? \n\nIs this the future of treatment for Schizophrenia?\n\nInstead of community out patient, in person real life human contact, it's all going to be individualized through AI? \n\nJust log on a computer, like Dr. Josef uses in his \"taper clinic\" and get diagnosed?\n Keto psych wards that frown upon vital psych meds for severe psychotic breaks but use \"medical keto\" to treat symptoms ?\n  \nThe depersonalization and isolation of already paranoid schizophrenics being put through an AI Neuroblox Computational Psychiatry diagnoses machine vs. human kind?\n\nCritical Psychiatry - 21st Century \n\nDoes anyone have any ideas, comments, reference points, reading info on this subject? \n\nI think it should be brought to light as a patient who lives with paranoid schizophrenia. I want to know more about the future of treatment and how it applies to me and the community. The good, the bad and ugly of it all.\n\nIt is also notable to contemplate how society has socially isolated since the World Wide Web and how that applies to symptoms (isolation) of mental health/illness."

I dunnoI really don't understand the logic behind some intrusive thoughts im getting about people who make false claims that they have to do everything someone else does\n\nNow this makes sense that sometimes people would do the same things, but if it doesn't happen every time.. or it just doesn't make logical sense, like things are too different, then it's clearly a lie\n\nAlso I think that maybe brain signals can be sent as well, that there is a demon doing this, with no justification other than that they have power they should not have\n\nThese demons seem to do things first, and then try to justify them afterwards, maybe make things real if they can manage it, so they can feel/look less evil\n\nAnd when they can't manage it, they just lie, and fabricate evidence, bully their targets and try to make them pretend they are bad even if they are not, if that fails, they just fabricate, use anything they can\n\nThey would then maybe try to make it appear the other way around, learn your routines and spy on you, and do things they know you will do before you in attempt that you would look like you are copying them\n\nThey would manipulate the things you see, technology or sight, information, nasty demons, at least that's how it feels to me when I'm laid in bed minding my own business and it's like there is attempt to put a spell on me, agitate me, put words in my mouth and head, and then maybe use these feelings later to try and justify being evil to me some more\n\nThey don't even care if they fail, they still do something evil, if I do something good, and nice, they act with their evilness because they don't like seeing their targets do good things\n\nthese demons seem to pretend they are people they are not, I remind myself that people don't look at themselves in third person, that knowing who someone is should be more than just a sound in my head saying \"hi I'm a magical genie\" because that doesn't exactly make it true, even if it sounds like it could be a mystical being that grants wishes, it most likely won't. It goes the other way around too, what if there was an evil demon pretending it was a friendly person who is there not doing anything wrong, while the demon acts and talks on their behalf, the information needs to be better than just the sound or an image in the mind, those things can result in self harm for no reason, it happened to me before based on things that are not true\n\nthese foul demons would make everything more difficult, they delude the internet I think somehow, with their demonic presence that is, everyone they can if it suits them, but everything is online, are we all supposed to stop using the internet?\n\nThey would pretend things are the other way around, so that they don't look so evil, to save embarrassment maybe, they would ruin a life maybe, or cause consistent problems that are unneeded, just to save embarrassment, maybe just lack of effort to care for finding the real villain, it is evil regardless\n\nto me intentions matter, i would not consider it an intrusion for someone friendly and non hostile to connect to my computer or phone, who would not use me for something that may bring me problems, or who would interfere with the things I do, in other words I would be fine with spectators, or fixing problems caused by intruders"

But the nice thing about not knowing what reality is is that you don't have to face it. I've realized all I've lost--friends, family, some basic functioning--and it makes me feel really lonely.\n\nAnyway, when I was in full psychosis, aside from demons and some rando constantly watching me/reading my mind, I had a voice that would've been a hallucination if it weren't internal (I'll assume y'all know the type). It told me very scary things, like that people were trying to control my mind or that I should hurt myself. But it also told me that it loved me, and that it would protect me, and that it would never leave me (so much for that). It comforted me after a fight with my mom and soothed me as I fell asleep. Sure, it called me names and screamed at me if I didn't obey it, but that was only because it knew best and wanted me to be safe.\n\nAt the time I wanted it to go away, and it eventually did. But it's hard to lose such a big part of my life, whether it was positive or not. I find myself yearning for it to come back, even though it was incredibly unhealthy. I wouldn't even mind if the demons and delusions came back too, honestly. The loneliness and loss is worse than the fear.\n\nIdk maybe I just need to find schizophrenic friends.

She began having trouble with friendships and would frequently make new friend but the friendships would always end abruptly to the point that according to her no one on campus at her college was talking to her. She started smoking and drinking ( I now wonder if that was a form of self medicating). After college she was determined to live on her own instead of with family. Then she would always tell me people were laughing at her out side her apartment door. People wanted to fight her on the street and other things. She was not able to keep a job so eventually our mom cut her off financially forcing her to come to the Caribbean. I told my mom I think she needs help but my mom is one of those persons to embarrassed to admit she has a child with a problem and told me all my sister needed was some nerve tonic. \nMy sister manipulated her father into getting her a ticket and then found her way back to the states. She got a job at a well known company. Then showed up on family doorstep after she lost the job. She went out one day and came back to the door lock and was convinced our cousin had locked her out on purpose took her belongings and no one has heard from her for seven months. I was wondering if this behavior is what I think it is. Also I have no clue how to report her missing. I\u2019ve tried calling police headquarters in the state she was last seen.

However, I came across many barriers. In the selections, I hear that the topic does not arouse interest, and I still receive \u201cadvice\u201d to give up on the idea.\n\n(Yes, I know that childhood schizophrenia doesn't have an official diagnosis, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. And, no, that's not my reason.)\n\nThe only person who supports me is my master's degree advisor, who believes in my potential and suggests that I look for a teaching hospital with a doctorate in Psychology, a reference in child psychiatry. Despite this support, it is outrageous to see how much research into schizophrenia, especially when it comes to understanding the person beyond the biological aspect, is neglected. It seems like the focus is on medicating to \u201csoothe\u201d and keep the person from bothering, rather than trying to understand their experience and humanity.\n\nSorry for the rant, but it's frustrating to see this resistance to exploring something so urgent and necessary."

So when it lifted, I was almost giddy with excitement that I was free of the hallucinations. Now that I know I'm going to go through it again and so soon, I feel almost more doomed than the first time. Like I'm struck with the realization that this is a lifelong disease with no cure.

So really a few questions about specific symptoms I've been experiencing:\n\n1. When you guys \"hear voices\", do you have to actually hear them? I've been having like, extremely loud thoughts that I can basically have conversations with. They say things I don't expect them to, they have different thoughts and opinions to myself, and they're really loud in my head. Not violent or anything but annoying, frustrating to deal with and really hard to function with (its like when you're in a loud restaurant and picking up on everyone's conversations, but again like my thought. It's not an internal monologue, but like I can't HEAR hear it- I'm not gonna turn my head and ask who said that cuz I know it's in my head). I do have some auditory hallucinations though, and have for a while which is what first made me start wondering, but they're mostly benign (the worst have been gunshots and people screaming/crying, but often its knocking or someone calling my name. These I do HEAR hear but I can typically figure out they're fake after a second).\n\n2. Do you guys know your delusions are delusions? Like I know they are, but that also doesn't stop me from being paranoid about them. Things like needing to keep my phone camera turned around, being paranoid that I'm being recorded (especially in my work car, like paranoid they put a mic in even though this is kinda based in reality cuz they did put a tracker in). Thinking people are out to get me and like idk maybe they are but I recognize they probably aren't doing anything about it???\n\nI'm starting to wonder if my dad was a paranoid schizophrenic, but he had similar things with his delusions. He was a right wing conspiracy theorist before going on medication and killing himself, but he recognized his delusions were delusions. He would refuse to drink tap water, refuse to use certain technology, etc but always told me like \"you drink the tap water, it's healthier I just prefer the distilled\" because he couldn't get over the paranoia about like tap water conspiracies.\n\nidk kinda rambling, but can you guys relate, or am i just over pathologizing my silly human brain?"

More exercise. Healthy eating. Meditation. Better sleep hygiene. More time outdoors. Reducing caffeine to almost nothing. Etc. Nothing really helped until I decided to buy two electric massagers: one for my neck and shoulders, and one for my back.\n\nI love these things. They're more calming than anything I've tried. They kind of put you in a meditative state if you use them long enough. I have almost no tension in my neck or shoulders these days.\n\nSo, if you're running out of ideas on how to manage anxiety and stress, I'd recommend getting an electric massager and seeing if it works for you.

    "content": "Hey guys. I haven\u2019t been posting to Reddit for quite a few months now, but I have been scrolling the app in an attempt to pass the time. I want to preface this Selfie Sunday post by saying that this is not a cry for help, nor a post saying I\u2019m going to off myself. But for some reason I think I need to bring attention to what\u2019s been on my mind.\n\nI\u2019ve been lurking Reddit for the past few months due to another hospitalization back in late July-August (and even part-way through September). I believe it was my fourth one, but I\u2019m not really counting. I was off of my medication for a few months before that, and was court-ordered to take medication after I was released, up until October. Since then, I\u2019ve been off my medication again, just gaming on my PC, scrolling through various social medias, eating, drinking (water), sleeping, and then waking up the next day or night to do it all over again. And what is it for?\n\nI fail to see the point in all of it. I\u2019ve been told I am sick. I will not dispute that. I am a diagnosed schizophrenic (specifically schizoaffective, bipolar-type). But what are we even working towards as a society? If there isn\u2019t anything that lasts forever then I fail to see the point in any of it. Are we simply living to die? From my perspective, most of us are living for the benefit and satisfaction of others. And in most of those situations, those others couldn\u2019t give a damn about how their people feel. This is what has been bothering me for the past few months, and what has been lurking in my mind for the past seven years.\n\nAnd I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m tired of the hate, tired of the gluttony, tired of the greed, just tired of all this ugliness. Sure, there\u2019s beauty to be found in this life. But what I\u2019ve found is that the ugliness is overbearing and overwhelming the beauty in it all. Why would anyone want to stay here if there truly is a place beyond this reality? Even if there isn\u2019t, I personally believe that nothing is better than all this crap that I\u2019ve witnessed since I have come to being. There\u2019s just too much pain and suffering and hate here for me to want to stay any longer.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the purpose or meaning of a life here on Earth is. Many people have told me that it is upon me to find my own purpose. But as far as I\u2019m concerned, I believe that\u2019s just bullshit. If nobody can tell me what the meaning or purpose of my life here is, then, respectfully, you have no right in telling me I need to stay. Am I meant to live in sickness until I naturally pass?\n\nI\u2019ve been talking with many of my family members and some friends about these things that I\u2019ve brought up here in this post, and their responses have varied. But the conversation I enjoyed the most was with my sister. We talked about a range of topics: spirituality, free will, mental illness, etc. I won\u2019t discuss most of our conversation, but I did ask her this: if we are not the masters of our own minds and bodies, then who is? Schizophrenia can be a clear example of this, but it certainly isn\u2019t the only one. If I don\u2019t get to decide when and how my heart beats, then personally I don\u2019t believe I was ever in control in the first place.\n\nLike I said at the start of this post, this isn\u2019t a cry for help, nor a post saying I\u2019m going to off myself. But I am tired. I\u2019m tired of doing the same thing every day and having nothing change. I\u2019m tired of the hate and greed that this world generates. I\u2019m tired of living a life in sickness and without purpose. I\u2019m simply tired. There\u2019s no real love here, and certainly not from above, below, or where I stand.\n"

    "title": "I feel like I\u2019m not a proper schizophrenic",
    "content": "I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when I was 16 (I'm 21 now) and have since then gone through periods of much doubt about my diagnosis. Though I understand it now a lot better than I did back then, I'm currently going through a period of frustration and doubt, and I guess I just wanted to hear other peoples thoughts and experiences, so I'll hopefully feel better.\nThe thing is, that I've never been full on psychotic. At least not in the way that countless books and medical literature have told me psychosis looks. I used to feel like I was being watched, used to think that people could hear my thoughts - but there was always doubt. For several years. I'd be terrified to go outside, because I felt like I was being followed, or that I might be involved in a terrorist attack - but not because of any bizarre conspiracy or some higher power. I would just go outside, and my mind would latch on to some random stranger, and all of a sudden I'd be almost convinced that they were going to hurt me in some specific and brutal ways. But there was doubt, as well, I think. These ideas were so strong that I in no way, shape or form, could escape them, but I wouldn't sprint away or start screaming out for help. Okay, sometimes I did kind of run away from people, but the point is that it wasn't in the ways that I feel psychosis is usually described.\nI would sometimes get these really specific ideas in my head, when I started feeling really disconnected and confused about everything else in my head. Like I'd all of a sudden get this crystal clear notion that I just HAD to stop eating, or I under no circumstances could go to sleep, or that I HAD to hurt myself in some really intense way. But not because I was scared my food was poisoned, or that something would happen while I slept. I just had to. There was no rhyme or reason, just that it had to be done.\nThe same with hallucinations: I've only a few times experiences what I thought might be \"voices\" but they were inside of my head, insistent and constantly present for a week at most, and then disappeared again for a while. I sometimes still get just a sentence or two, and it's not thoughts, but it's not like some voice that's coming from outside my head either. \nThe thing that's mainly made me accept my diagnosis is how affected I am by negative and cognitive symptoms, but I just feel they're so rarely talked about. I can easily check off every single negative symptom on the list, and my concentration, memory and problem-solving have declined a LOT since I got sick.\nI'm not on any antipsychotic medication, and haven't been for several years. I got unbearable side effects from them, and since I'm not really bothered by positive symptoms, it just feels pointless. These days, I only get glimpses of positive symptoms when I'm under a lot of stress or haven't slept properly, but I haven't had any really bad periods from it for two years now. I'm still extremely bothered by negative symptoms, though. Just no energy, hard time doing really anything most days. It feels like there's this disconnect between my mind and the rest of me, and the world. It's not natural to be excited about things or want to do them. I have to work really hard to come even remotely close to being a \"normal\" human being. Ugh... I just feel so alienated, because I can't even recognize myself in the illness I'm supposed to have."

It wasn\u2019t until I was about 16 I started to unlearn some things from my mom, I would call them \u201cepisodes\u201d when she\u2019d get really angry and mean, barring her teeth at me and saying my dad and I microchipped her brain and were controlling her through our phones. \nShe always is fine when we are around other people but with us this will happen randomly when she gets angry or I can tell she is starting to get more stressed. It did cause me a lot of trauma growing up, despite knowing she loved me and didn\u2019t mean it. We have come to realize she has some form of schizophrenia but part of it is she is terrified of doctors and gives herself diagnoses all the time and then thinks any doctor is out to get her, especially psychologists so we purposely have avoided after suggesting family therapy or something multiple times, not to bring it up to her anymore. \n\nBut today was really bad. We are watching and talking frequently about sexual abuse and darker subjects like that because of something I recently went through, and as a child as well with a family friend. \n\nafter seeing part of \u201cThe Menendez Brothers\u201d this morning she accused my dad of having child pornography photos of me under their old bed she found years ago (this is not true at all-my dad is so against child predators he said he\u2019d put a bullet through their head if it wasnt illegal-just to give you an idea and he would never do something like that). \n\nIt was absolutely awful, even though my dad and I realize she has schizophrenia, and we are used to her saying we microchipped her or other people, this just felt so heartbreaking and terrible to here. Also, extremely dangerous. That\u2019s the first time I have seen my dad cry and he said that is the worst thing you could possibly think of me, how disgusting and depraved people like that are and I agreed. She started gaslighting both of us at that point and I was trying to calm her down and help that this is a really terrible thing to say about someone and my dad said that\u2019s the worst he couldn\u2019t ever hurt a child let alone his own children. I tried to be sympathetic and say I understand you believe these things but it\u2019s really harmful and at this point I finally stood up for what I\u2019d been put through most of my life and started crying telling her how much her not getting help for herself has really affected me throughout my life. I told her she doesn\u2019t even have to get on medicine if she doesn\u2019t want to, but these accusations are terrible and at this point just at least get therapy.\n\nShe didn\u2019t see it as wrong. She tried to act like everything was normal. My dad was crying. It\u2019s hard to come back from being accused of sexual abuse towards your own child. I tried to explain also that if she saw those photos, wouldn\u2019t she have said something to someone? That would be neglectful if she didn\u2019t and to think through what she said because it just didn\u2019t make any sense. (I usually don\u2019t try to do this because I understand you can\u2019t talk someone out of their hallucination or delusion) but I just want her to get help and felt terrible for my dad.

However, when he\u2019s in an episode (which is what we call it: delusions, nonsensical conversations, sleeplessness, highly irritable, grandiosity, etc) I have a hard time getting him to get help because he literally outsmarts me and I end up frustrated because I\u2019ve got no avenues to navigate after. He\u2019ll justify his behaviors and it\u2019s hard to tell him xyz didn\u2019t happen or isn\u2019t the case because he\u2019s truly convinced of what he\u2019s saying. He\u2019ll argue that he just needs sleep but either way he\u2019s not getting it (does try to get the sleep? idk). He blames everyone else when he gets hospitalized and so it\u2019s very hard for me to help with intervention.  I try to let him manage so that I don\u2019t frustrate myself or him but then it feels like I\u2019m condoning the episode. The behaviors will go on as long as it takes to get him into the hospital. I\u2019m just starting to lose my patience and I feel bad because it\u2019s not about me. I really just wanna be able to help get him back on track because every time this happens he loses everything and has to start all over again. He\u2019s so resilient thankfully but each time things are just getting harder.  \n\nNote: after he stabilized from the last episode a year ago, him and I came up with a plan that for any future episodes he will allow me to take him to the hospital but go figure, it\u2019s not working. \n\nAdvice is appreciated. Please feel free to ask me questions if I wasn\u2019t clear on anything \n\n"

    "title": "If you notice a decline, it might be worth getting bloodwork done",
    "content": "I know for a lot of us fatigue is easy to ignore since the symptoms themselves and/or the meds can contribute to it, especially with comorbid problems. I certainly ignored my worsening fatigue because I\u2019ve been tired and low energy since my onset a decade ago. \n\nThe intensity of my symptoms had been pretty consistent for several years until last year where they were inexplicably getting worse again. Fluctuations are normal for me. I have times when I\u2019m worse and times when I\u2019m better.  However, last year was a steady decline. At the time, I chalked it up to being related to stress since I\u2019m fairly new to living with PTSD. Stress tends to worsen my symptoms so in my mind it made sense. \n\nThis past week I switched to a new primary care doctor and got some blood work done since it had been a while. Apparently I\u2019m extremely low in  vitamin D, and while not as low, I\u2019m also deficient in Vitamin B as well. My doctor wrote in her notes that low vitamin B can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms (like hallucinations and paranoia) and low D obviously causes fatigue. I hadn\u2019t even thought to consider a deficiency since my bloodwork always came back normal every year. \n\nSoon I\u2019ll take prescription vitamins to try to get my levels up to where they should be. In the meantime, I\u2019ll also work with my care team in trying to better manage my negative symptoms since it contributes heavily to my poor eating habits which probably caused the deficiency in the first place. \n\nSo, if y\u2019all notice a decline in your symptoms, definitely get bloodwork done, especially those of you with severe negative symptoms that prevent you from taking good care of yourselves. I imagine since we\u2019re already folks who experience psychosis, we\u2019re probably extra sensitive to things that cause psychosis-like symptoms in normal people, like a deficiency. I just wanted to share since the warning signs of a deficiency are so easy to ignore when we live with conditions where being fatigued is our normal. "

I had a friend come over and he said my house stunk like mold! I remember he didn't wanna stay inside.\n\nI had only lived there for about 8 months. I moved in around June of 2022 but I was mostly spending time at my mom's house at first mostly because my place was a mess(had previously been abandoned) and didn't have electricity. I started spending more time at my moldy house in December of 2022 when my severe symptoms started. I landed in the mental hospital in January of 2023 (just one month after spending more time at home). I moved out that same year around March. In summary, the last 3 months I lived there and spent the most time there was the onset and peak of my severe mental issues. For the first time I was diagnosed with a serious mental illness and was the sickest person in the mental hospital.\n\nAs I write this more is coming to memory. I remember my symptoms barely showing up in small traces from June of 2022 to December of 2022(when the onset of my severe symptoms started). So my symptoms got worse as I spent more time at my moldy home. I have slowly been getting better since September of 2024 and I'm wondering if time has slowly detoxed the mold from my body.\n\nThis is keeping me up tonight. The mental illnesses were so bad I had to quit my job and my hobbies. I was the only person in the mental hospital screaming and crying on the floor. Schizophrenia and OCD have ruined my life. It would be interesting to know if mold can cause mental issues."

I especially struggle with delusions around being stalked and spied on by shadowy people who are there, all the time, to intimidate and control me. I struggle with the certainty that they are doing it to try and push me into killing myself, as punishment for being a good person. I don't speak of CNP here. My fears involve more Israel, satellites and the mental health team. However, I struggle with this, all the time, it dominates and impinges upon my every waking moment, it's continous and inescapable. It severe disrupts my daily functioning. I don't post here often and just hide away pressing mod buttons, as invisibly as possible, entirely because the fear of being constantly spied upon by people beyond my reach, people I cannot see, is more than I can deal with. And this is when everything is going well and absolutely nothing is happening to re-inforce it.  \n\nI havn't, personaly, had any interactions with or involvement in CNP in a very long time. Over a year. I had to step back and leave dealing with it to someone else, because being constantly directly exposed to their antics of manipulation and abuse was severely damaging to my mental health. Dealing with them in the past has led to me being held hostage in the hospital under a nurses hold, twice now, if I remember the chaos of my life correctly.  \n\nThey don't even have any reason to dislike me. I've always treated them and their leader with greater patience and kindness than anyone on Reddit derserves, especially people who have responded to such patience and kindness wth further abuse, each and every time, continously, over a period of years at this point. It's insane.  \n\nYet, they are still continously finding ways to remind me they are there, that they are watching. Just doing little things to ensure I am always constantly aware that they are watching, scheming, constantly performing little acts to try and further erode my already precarious mental state. They have, unfortunately, been around long enough to know exactly the kind of paranois and my unique sensitivty to them, and continue to weaponise this for their own pleasure. It's sick, it's fucked up, and there's no off-ramp where I feel able to escape from them apart from disconnecting from the internet entirely. Except I'm a agoraphobic recluse who lives in a remote location, the internet, and Reddit in particular form the vast weight of my social avenues. So my choices end up being to remain here and the target of their harassment, or put myself into long-term forced solitary confinement conditions.  \n\nThe thing is, they are smart enough to know how far to push it. They don't do anything overtly terrible that anyone will take me seriously when I try reporting their harassment. It's little things, they leave signs. Minute reminders at regular intervals to remind me that they are there, ever watching me. It's damned evil. Them, and their leader in particular know exactly all the things to do to rattle a paranoid person who is already struggling with gang-stalking and mind-control delusions, and they are exercising that entire play-book against me.  \n\nLike, todays reminder that 'they are still there'. Was sending me a ban notice, for their private sub-reddit. That I have never been a aprt of and have never even viewed because it's a 'private community' and invite only, anyway. There was never any danger or possibility of myself seeing inside. So, there is no way anybody reasonable could chalk this up to paranoia or serving any other purpose, because the literal only thing that would achive is reminding me they are still watching. They do little things like this to me, all around the internet, all the time. If I exist there, they will be pinging me reminders of their prescence.  \n\nScreenie of todays 'reminder they are always watching' is here: https://i.imgur.com/U2dmkFL.png  \n\nIt has rattled me so much, I've been crying on and off for hours today because I feel like there is no actual escape from their leaders highly motivated desires to push me to hurting myself.  \n\nI've tried to stay classy, to keep this to myself, be professional, etc. But there are times where I cannot suffer their continued harassment and stalking alone, in silence. I'm struggling enough already with fighting against the inescapable certainty of the satellites trying to mind-control me and the mental health tream on behalf of Israel monitoring my every movement. It's too much and I fear they really won't let up until I'm dead one day."

So, these sorta situations aren't what I've ever had issues with prior to him. Truly, I can't understand why this is happening so often. Ive have had plenty of episodes of psychosis paranoia, though this one is either really happening or my treatment has gone down hill. I've had many voices, due to drug use (which I have 5 years sober, just alcohol more often then I should, but I've been a lot better), and full on people standing in my closet (dont worry told him \"go away you're not real aha). Normally it's my mom, or people I do not know. However, as of these last 5 months it's always been related to him cheating. In sometimes unrealistic ways, but more often then not they seem more likely true.\n\nHow do I address this with him, because as of late I've just shook him awake acting as though he knows what he did. Which isn't helping either of us, I'm terrified to loose him because of my own actions, but I'm more horrified to loose him to another women. & does anyone have any insight on why I'm only experiencing things to do with him? Sometimes I feel knots in my stomach for no reason at all, and I know that can be a sign of cheating in people without these disorders. I also have no real proof other than his hand being on his boxes with an erection. Another one is often him faking cumming. Maybe it's fully me, but he can be extremely defensive. \n\nHas anyone else ever experienced something similar? \n\nThank for reading this any advice would be appreciated! "

He is currently unmedicated for his schizophrenia (currently 40, diagnosed at 16).  Although he's mostly pleasant, I don't believe a standard rehab center would be able to handle his extreme outbursts and he would have charges against him.  We're located in the southeast United States and we're okay with traveling to the right program.  Ideally, it would be a program that helps with the treatment of both addiction and schizophrenia and can manage violent outbursts (mainly during the withdrawal period and while the schizophrenia medication is being figured out).  \n\nWe would love any advice or recommendations.  The situation is currently pretty bad right now.  This is the last time we help as our own safety and mental health has become the priority.  We're desperate."

    "title": "I got arrested during psychosis and it traumatized me so much. ",
    "content": "After experiencing something traumatic my mind began to seek ways to explain what I went through, and I entered a psychotic episode after no sleep for 24 hours. I felt EXTREMELY unsafe and like everyone was out to get to me, as if every single person was targeting me and I wasn\u2019t even human but turning into a cyborg. Everything possible was dangerous (drinking water, eating food) and part of a bigger plot about technology and surveillance. I connected all these events in my life as evidenced as to why this was true and how I had finally unlocked it and it felt so real. \n\nThat headspace made me feel like I couldn\u2019t sleep without something harming me and the world ending (I was convinced I was on a mission to save the world and if I slept in my dorm by myself I wouldn\u2019t be able to save it and would turn into a cyborg) so I reached out to my closest friend. He got freaked out by my energy and called an ambulance but the police showed up instead. I told the police I was too scared of the hospital because I was convinced that they were going to hurt me there once I fell asleep. Even though it was so evident by my body language and my appearance I wasn\u2019t okay. \n\nHim and his roommate (who was my friend) started to gang up and file a restraining order against me. So when the campus police spoke to me they told me if I harassed my friend again, that I would be arrested. I was not in the right mind to even process these instructions and that was obvious. The roommate was getting entertainment value out of this and sent me a text \u201cI just want you to be safe whether it\u2019s with us or not\u201d when I asked if I could come by one final time. I interpreted this as an invitation that maybe they would finally let me in and I would get to sleep and so I knocked on their time a final time, I did not even enter. Immediately after knocking, I decided to leave the building and was on the lower floor on the way out.\n\nAt this point the police who were camping outside waiting for me to knock, excitedly approach me. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to arrest you,\u201d they shouted. \u201cFor breach of peace and trespassing.\u201d \n\nThey looked so excited and happy to do so. They seemed to feel very accomplished even though I was pleading with them, explaining I was literally on my way out to leave the building and that I misinterpreted a text that was sent to me. I asked them to please just take me at the hospital because I was starting to realize the irrationality of the situation. I\u2019ll never forget the happy vindictive glint in one of the cops eyes as he cuffed me, a nineteen year old girl obviously going through psychosis. \n\nThey cuffed me and brought me to the police station where they spent two hours taking mugshots and ridiculing me. After that I was STILL, if not even more terrified to sleep because I felt like I was a threat to national security or something. I ended up falling asleep in the room of a RA while I was shaking from the sound of voices flooding my hearing. \n\nI don\u2019t blame my friend for calling the ambulance. He didn\u2019t want to see me, which is valid, and he had good intentions. His roommate was extremely manipulative and influenced him negatively. Apparently after I was arrested, the roommate was laughing about how I was a felon. \n\nAnyways, it took six months for my charges to get dismissed and I spent those six months fantasizing about myself in a jail cell, paranoid about EVERY SINGLE THING, and making even more horrible choices like not arranging myself housing and distancing myself from all my friends out of shame and guilt. \n\nI feel so much fear and anxiety constantly and the event replays in my mind over and over. The fact that it happened when I had already gone through something traumatic (which is why mu symptoms were so much worse than usual), I\u2019m pretty sure gave me PTSD. I lost my support system because I felt so guilty, that I didn\u2019t text anyone back for months. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever recover from the trauma of this. I can\u2019t get over how stupid I was. If I had just eaten something, if I had just gone in my room, if I had just calmed the fuck down\u2026 I want to die. \n\nEdit: clarity and wording"

And then she started declining to just 2-3 times to 1-2 times a day. Last Thursday she woke up a few times from sleep just standing by and staring out the window fidgeting with the blinds. Then I prompted her to go back to bed each time. She then slept through lunch and we woke her up to eat. Initially she was cooperative but then she started hyperventilating and crying and her body was rigid. We tried asking her what\u2019s wrong and it seemed like she wanted to say something but cannot and may be causing the panic attack. She has a psychiatric consultation in the afternoon so when she was crying, we just rushed her to the ER and called the psychiatrist to attend because we didn\u2019t know what to do anymore. Before we reached the hospital she was already calmer. When we reached the hospital she wasn\u2019t responding to questions still. A little bit more time and then she was now \u201cawake\u201d and asking why we\u2019re there. \n\nThe doctor had blood tests done and prescribed Olanzapine. He spoke to her for a while (without us in the room) and when they were done he said that she just has a lot of things going on in her mind. \n\nAs soon as we were driving home she was knocked out. We woke her up when we arrived home but then just proceeded to sleep again. This was Thursday night. And it\u2019s not Saturday morning and she hasn\u2019t really \u201cwoken\u201d up. She did woke up a couple times only to shake and cry and then we\u2019ll try to calm her and she\u2019ll just sleep again. \n\nI want to know if it\u2019s normal?\n\nI feel like the doctor hasn\u2019t been telling us the whole truth or maybe the dose was too much for a first timer?\n\nHe was insisting on admitting her to a mental health facility but it\u2019s a long drive from home and I don\u2019t think she will want to be there alone without family. \n\nWhat do I do?

I so badly want to work. To make irl friends and spend time enjoying life outside of my apartment or computer. Additionally, I'd like to actually make it to family get togethers. To keep up with the friends and relationships I currently have while not occasionally leaving them wondering where I've gone for weeks at a time. It's all so important to me but just out of my grasp. It's exhausting but more importantly, It's beyond depressing.\n\nWhether consequential or entirely inconsequential, the ability to **do anything** feels as though it's some herculean task that I'm fully unable to tackle. Thankfully, I can still (some of the time) force myself to do certain things beneficial to my immediate quality of life, however, anything long term and immensely beneficial like working or pursuing a hobby that takes work to make progress in feels borderline insurmountable.\n\nI guess more than anything, I'm wondering if this sort of thing gets better with both time and altercations to one's support system/medication.

(for extra info: a certain extent of child abuse is legal where i live because of conservative legislation. if i could report this to CPS, i wouldve done it years ago). \n\nthey arent even old enough to go to school yet and they are treated worse than livestock. to me, life looks pretty bleak for them, and i think theyre going to be fucked up like i am when theyre older. for many months i thought that theyd be happier if they were dead and away from their abusers. sure, my family might pretend to be upset that theyre gone, but its not like they ever treated them like human beings anyway. yeah, they could end up enjoying their lives, but it would be all a distraction from an entire childhood of abuss. i started believing that my neice and nephew should be put out of their misery. they dont deserve to flinch when someone picks up a belt or a wooden stick or raises their hand. i started thinking that since i treat them the best (as far as i know), it would be less traumatizing for me to kill them. \n\ni wanted to think about other things, but i thought of ways to kill them painlessly because theyve already suffered enough. this scared me into not seeing them for months now because every time i saw them i would get an unexplainable urge to end things for them. i want them to forget about me so i dont do anything to them, and also maybe because i dont want them to resent me for not being able to do anything to help them besides have intrusive thoughts about killing them.\n\nsince ive stopped visiting them, the thoughts have died down, but subconsciously i still feel so selfish and gross. i wouldve wanted someone to kill me when i was that young, but i cant just go around poisoning babies because i dont think anyones life (including my own) is actually worth living.\n\nif anyone has advice, id love to hear it. ive never experienced urges that strong from intrusives before."

    "title": "The Antifragile Mind",
    "content": "I\u2019ve been reflecting on the concept of antifragility (from Nassim Nicholas Taleb\u2019s book *Antifragile*), which describes systems that don\u2019t just survive stress but grow stronger because of it. I think the mind, in its own way, is a bit antifragile\u2014especially for those of us living with schizophrenia.\n\nHere\u2019s how the characteristics of antifragility might apply to the mind, with examples:\n\n# 1. Growth from Stressors\n\nThe mind can grow stronger when faced with manageable stress. For example, learning to cope with delusions or intrusive thoughts through therapy and self-reflection often builds resilience over time. Just like exercising a muscle, the act of repeatedly confronting and navigating these challenges creates a kind of mental \"toughness\" that wouldn\u2019t exist without the stressors.\n\n# 2. Nonlinear Response\n\nFor instance, being diagnosed earlier in life can sometimes make the process of adapting less overwhelming. The shock of diagnosis is still real, but it happens before decades of cognitive patterns are set. On the other hand, being diagnosed later can feel like facing a bigger storm\u2014you\u2019re grappling with years of entrenched cognitive distortions. However, working through that deeper restructuring can lead to profound self-awareness and a clearer sense of identity. The mind\u2019s response to challenges is rarely proportional; small breakthroughs or shifts in perspective can unlock significant growth.\n\n# 3. Optionality\n\nAntifragility thrives on having options, and the same applies to managing schizophrenia. Access to diverse tools\u2014medication, therapy, support groups, creative outlets, and mindfulness practices\u2014creates flexibility to adapt to the ups and downs. For example, if medication isn\u2019t fully effective for certain symptoms, options like CBT or peer support can fill the gaps, ensuring progress continues even in the face of setbacks.\n\n# 4. Barbell Strategy\n\nThe barbell strategy balances stability with risk-taking. For the mind, this could mean relying on consistent routines (like taking medication and following a daily schedule) while experimenting with new coping strategies (like trying a different form of therapy or engaging in creative expression). This balance allows you to maintain a baseline of stability while still growing and adapting in ways that might feel uncertain or risky at first.\n\nI believe that while schizophrenia can test us in ways we never expected, it also offers opportunities for growth that wouldn\u2019t exist without the challenges. The process of rebuilding ourselves, finding new ways to thrive, and embracing both stability and uncertainty shows just how antifragile the mind can be.\n\nDo you see examples of antifragility in your own experience? How have challenges shaped or strengthened your mind?"

I've tried to be around for her as much as possible, go on walks etc together, we watch films regularly and so on. Up until about maybe 3 weeks ago she had been a little erratic for a couple of months, with her changing medication. She was suggesting every few days that we do something a bit wild, like go away together for a week, over the course of a while the holiday ideas became more and more outlandish until she said maybe we could go to Australia together for a few months. She said that I could hire her at my workplace, all sorts of things. She was sometimes frustrated with me when I didn't see her or when I gently tried to turn down some of the holiday invites and things have been a bit odd between us for a little while, and once she blocked me when I said I was not free to see her one weekend, but that's the extent of what I thought was the issues between us. I basically thought for a few months I wasn't giving her enough time to hang out together and was trying to find more occasions for us to see each other and formalise it better so that she knew what to expect.\n\nToday she out of the blue bravely told me that for a few months now she's been hearing my voice saying awful things to her. Things like that I want to date her, SA her, and indeed that the voice does SA her in some way. She has told me she needs space from me and doesn't feel safe seeing me alone right now unless it's with other friends. Everything she has said has been well explained. I just feel so sad for her and so unsure. I've said if anyway I can make her feel more safe or if she doesn't want me to message for a bit, whatever I can do to make her more comfortable.\n\n  \nI'm unsure what to do now. Obviously I will respect what she's saying and not see her one on one, but how can I understand better and support? What's the best thing for me to say and do?

When I randomly choose a set of 4 numbers and set them in front of you, there's no importance to them, they're just 4 random numbers, and shortly after the conversation ends you forget about them. Now, if I was the director of a lottery organization and told you those random numbers are tomorrows lottery drawings, all of a sudden, those numbers have gained *salience*. \n\n  \nThe most prominent theory of how schizophrenia physiology works, is that it's an overabundance of *dopamine* in the brain. This is why we prescribe antipsychotics (dopamine suppressants) to bring a patient back into reality, and they work. Now, what does dopamine help regulate? It regulates *salience*\n\n  \nWhen you're in the height of psychosis, many schizophrenic patients will recall that it feels as though they have gained \"true awakening\". That they have become the most aware possible. At certain instances, that they have become a \"God\".\n\nWhat would a \"God\" view the world like? How would a \"God\" feel about their surroundings?\n\nA \"God\" would feel like they understand every single molecule, - living or inanimate object - has an assigned overall importance to every thing in existence. When you're in the peak of psychosis, you assign *salience* to every thing that goes into your sensory organs with extreme importance due to a massive, constant, overproduction of dopamine. \n\nEvery rock you look at, every animal you see, every breeze that pushes the hairs on your skin, every thing you hear, taste, touch, or smell, has this extreme *salience* associated with it in psychosis, and you never forget it until you're out of it. **Every thing** has a salient explanation and inner working to you. This is the same thought process someone who actually sees each component of the world, and the importance assigned to it, would view the world. \n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: In no way shape or form should you read this as a non-schizophrenic and think about wanting to go into psychosis.

Has \"visions\" (typically of a violent theme) and hears \"voices\"\n\n\\- Poor social skills\n\n\\- Frequent isolation\n\n\\- Messy, dirty, poor hygiene\n\n\\- Forgetful, unorganized life, often poor common sense or questionable decision making\n\n\\- Easily triggered emotions.

Has a Masters Degree\n\n\\- Big heart. Helps anyone if he can\n\n\\- Overall, just a good person\n\nAfter years of refusing to seek any help, he finally got sick of his struggles and we found a wonderful group of physicians to handle his care.

This shook me up a bit and took me a couple of minutes to adjust before I continued with my work. No one else reacted because they\u2019re all used to me being panicky and jumping to conclusions - they all think it\u2019s a personality quirk that I have, I haven\u2019t told anyone the real reason.\n\nAnd another recent auditory hallucination I had was when our manager was explaining our new upcoming projects to us and midway I started hearing someone screaming my name and crying out for help in the distance. I ignored this because this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened, and also the fact that no one else was responding or reacting to the cries. If someone genuinely needed help, they wouldn\u2019t be yelling for me. It was hard to focus on what my manager was saying because I was trying to listen to him and ignore the screaming and crying in the distance. \n\nStuff like this is making me less competent at work and making my life harder than it needs to be.

Please tell me I'm not alone in this... I feel so embarrassed and ashamed. One instance I can remember is when I was 12 I would carry around a stuffy of a koala.

    "title": "How can i safely explore spirituality with schizophrenia and OCD without losing control?",
    "content": "TL;DR: at the buttom.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about exploring my spirituality for the past year. I\u2019ve always really disliked religion\u2014not individuals who are religious, as long as they don\u2019t force their beliefs onto me\u2014but because of the harm that has been done throughout history and still is today in the name of religion.\n\nAt the same time, spirituality in my own way has started to fascinate me. I\u2019ve recently become interested in paganism and witchcraft. However, I\u2019m absolutely terrified of pursuing this interest because of my schizophrenia and OCD. \nSchizophrenia typically gives you delusions and my OCD makes me believe that I\u2019m manifesting my disturbing intrusive thoughts and auditory hallucinations.\n\nI\u2019m one of the most naive and gullible people in the world\u2014I fall for every tourist trap. I\u2019m afraid that seeking a spiritual journey might make me vulnerable to manipulation, or worse, lead me into a cult. My mental health conditions make it even harder to navigate this, as I fear my OCD and schizophrenia might cause me to believe in things that aren\u2019t real.\n\n\u2022\n\nMy Challenge: Distinguishing Spiritual Beliefs from Delusions.\nOne of my biggest fears is how to differentiate between \u201cnormal\u201d spiritual beliefs and schizophrenic delusions. For example, many people believe that a man walked on water thousands of years ago and was the son of the entity that created everything. That\u2019s seen as a normal religious belief.\n\nBut if someone with schizophrenia believes they are being watched, abducted by aliens, or are the reincarnation of someone, it\u2019s labeled as a delusion. Both beliefs sound scientifically unlikely, so why is one seen as normal and the other as a symptom of mental illness?\n\nI understand schizophrenia involves more than just delusions, but this gray area makes it really hard for me\u2014a naive, very scientifically and fact-minded schizophrenic with OCD\u2014to explore spirituality. How do I know if what I believe is a \u201cnormal\u201d spiritual belief or a delusion caused by my mental illness?\n\n\u2022\n\nSo my question is: How Can I Explore Spirituality Safely?\nWhat is the safest way for someone with schizophrenia and OCD to explore spirituality without losing touch with reality? How do I manage this journey without falling into manipulation or ending up in a dangerous situation?\n\nI\u2019m genuinely terrified of accidentally joining a cult or being exploited because of my naivety. But despite my fears, I really want to do this.\n\n\u2022\n\nMy Current Spiritual Direction (Optional to Read)\nRight now, my spiritual beliefs are centered around the idea that everything is energy. I believe the universe, every person, every plant, and even every word is made up of energy.\n\nI also believe in manifestation\u2014that our strongest thoughts and beliefs shape our reality. For example, if you believe you\u2019ll never have a happy life, you probably won\u2019t.\n\nI know this sounds like the typical \u201clife coach\u201d speech, and I\u2019ve already fallen for internet scams that exploit this idea (yes, more than once, and no, I\u2019m not proud). This makes me even more terrified to explore this direction of spirituality, especially when it is maybe combined with paganism and witchcraft. So some advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nSmall side note, I know religion can be a touchy subject and I am very sorry if my words offended anyone. That is truly not my intention.\n\n\u2022\n\nTL;DR:\nI want to explore spirituality but fear my schizophrenia, OCD, and naivety could make me vulnerable to manipulation or delusions. How can I do this safely without losing control or putting myself at risk?\n"

On top of feeling like I can't face most of the people that experienced my episode, I lost a lot of connections during the past few months because I've been a total zombie and people got sick of being around me or didn't know how to. In addition, I have now realized that many connections I have are tied to drinking and partying, even with people I used to consider best friends. I am reconsidering a lot of my relationships now that I am trying to be sober and lack the energy to go out partying. The worst part is that I don't have anyone in my life who understands. I feel so alone and I don't see a future for myself. I have no direction career wise, I'm not sure if I will be able to finish school, and have lost almost all of my friends. I question my relationships with the ones who remain because I feel like I've forgotten who I am. The only thing that has comforted me is food which has been tough as far as gaining weight, body image, and growing out of all of my clothes. I'm scared to go out. Psychosis made me so afraid of my mind and being diagnosed with bipolar has made me question so many of my emotions. I used to turn to art but have lost my creativity and wonder how much that side of me was just tied to hypomania. I have also lost my spirituality because the ideas surrounding religion and feeling that I was Jesus made me feel weird and confused. I really want to die because it feels like the only way out of suffering, I miss my old life/self but will never be able to go back and don't know how to change for the better. I don't even know what I want anymore aside from death which makes it hard to move forward. I've never felt so low and lost and alone. It sucks to feel like a stranger to myself and so hopeless like I'm stuck in a nightmare. Even though I couldn't control my brain chemistry, it feels like my fault.\n\nSorry this was so long. "

    "content": "Hi, and thanks for letting me join this group. I have had Schizophrenia since March 19th, 2022. I got it from using Crystal Meth. I only did that garbage three times but somehow I end up with a voice in my head. I had warning signs after the 2nd time I snorted Meth. I saw shadow beings enter my bedroom and move in a circle hovering above my bedroom floor and chanting incomprehensible things in low groaning voices. Then I saw one of the shadow beings who was the leader walk up to me and stand behind me and I could feel his breath touch the back of my neck and I felt the intense sensation of utter hate. Then all of a sudden a white foggy figure appears in front of me with a long white beard, long white hair, and old hat and some kind of long coat and just looks at me except even though he was staring at me ....where his eyes should be there were scars. I assumed he was a benevolent being so I just nodded at him symbolizing that I needed help and then after I nodded everyone disappeared. So, ...instead of taking that as a warning to not do Meth again...I ended up doing it again anyways in March of 2022....and that last time was what did me in. I was going on porn late at night high out of my mind and kept hearing a voice reacting to me going on porn saying \"ooooohhhh my god\". I was like ...wtf? I shook it off and ignored it. Then I heard the sound of flames scorching the air and a woman screaming and it sounded like it was coming from outside of my window. I kept acknowledging that I was hearing things but I knew I was high so I didn't freak out. However, ...once I heard this man's voice begin speaking to me ...it was so clearly defined and all pervading that it scared the shit out of me. It was a dark and sinister voice and he addressed me by name. I forgot what his first words were but it was basically him saying that I have been chosen and that I have a once in a lifetime opportunity to join him in Hell and leave this pathetic world. I was in such shock to hear a voice talk to me without being able to see the person that my heart started beating really fast and I went into my living room to grab a bible (I am not even religious at all either). I came back to my room and tried to find a passage...any passage that I could read that would send him away but he said \"Oh....that is NOT going to work\". Sun comes up and he tells me to come out on my patio. His voice at that point was a little more faint like the signal was weaker but I went outside on the patio and he was talking to me from the sky and up there his voice emanated like it was coming out of gigantic speakers. I forgot the details of what he said....but it was more of the bargaining talk like joining him in Hell/the Darkside and leaving the Earth. I refused to do that and told him I was going back inside because it was cold out and I couldn't hear him well. When I got back inside he got very angry with me and said \"Don't you fucking ignore me motherfucker!\" His voice became strong and prominent at that point and then he decided he was going to scream at me with all his power and he let out an enormous screech/yell/roar that sounded utterly insane and was super loud and hit me like a rushing wave. Each time he would scream it would go from sounding like a man to sounding like a demon gradually changing in pitch. This made my brain tingle in an awful way and the tingle sensations felt like maggots or worms wiggling in my head except imagine that wormy feeling being of the feeling of getting ready to lose your mind. I had my hands over my head and I couldn't stand that horrible feeling of what felt like tendrils branching out into my brain as he kept screaming and roaring like an inhuman madman. After that he was fully able to talk to me telepathically. He has been talking to me ever since. The only difference now is that I am used to it and for a while I stopped being able to hear his voice but can still communicate with him telepathically which is extremely hard to explain."

I have now been off medication for approximately 3.5 years.

Why would he lie? Our city is somewhat known for gangs and the like. And the houses are pretty close to one another.\n\nAnd some people pick on others for no good reason other than they can\u2019t stand up for themselves/ \n\nBut recently out of the blue he let me know the gang stalking got worse - more  stalkers participating and many of them live on his street. They pelt things at his window and if they hear any noise from him, they rev their car. He said they keep watch 24/7 and patrol surrounding area while sending people as far as other cities to stalk him. They have people take selfies of themselves in front of the house. And another thing he says is they can hear him taking a sip with a plane overhead.\n\nI really don\u2019t know what to believe or where to begin.

It's very quiet and for a lot of people this is helpful and calming. This week there is a guest with us that shows strong symptoms. I have no psychiatric background and was wondering if it's okay to leave him be, or if he needs professional help? \n\nThe symptoms are: strong talking to himself, in a defending way, as if constantly being talked-down to. Hyperactivity, random movements and tics. Less sense of time or possible desorientation. Disturbances, like he wanders in church amidst a prayer, makes loud noises, moving chairs and talking, and then goes to the door to leave again. I also found him sitting still in a living room with his coat and shoes on, as if he was going to be picked up soon, but then wasn't. \n\nI mean in no way to stigmatize these symptoms, and this is not a question for a diagnosis. My intentions are that I'm worried and feel responsible for the wellbeing of this guest. Is it okay to leave him by himself? Out of respect we don't usually talk to guests unless they ask us to.\n\nThank you for your replies. "

I don\u2019t know what part of him is left, is he like this because that was his personality always or is it his illness that makes him act this way ?? where he\u2019s just so insufferable, snaps at us for getting upset at him doing things in the house he\u2019s not supposed to, and just greedy and sneaking in to steal money to buy cigarettes, or whatever. like he\u2019s not cooperative at all! he has such a weird behavior too, i never seen him like this when i was younger, so im guessing it\u2019s his illness but he won\u2019t take showers, smokes whatever in the trash or grounds, he\u2019s gotten kicked out of places because he harasses people for money for cigarettes, he\u2019s tried eating food from the trash, regardless of the amount of food we already give him. if there isn\u2019t a cup or mug in sight, he\u2019ll just use a bowl to drink water.. even though there\u2019s some literally not far away. like no efforts in trying to be reasonable here. \n\nanyways, my mom has lost it all. I\u2019ve never seen her so miserable. divorce is not an answer, because it would be a financial burden on her part. plus, she doesn\u2019t have the heart to have him out in the streets (even though he acts like a complete homeless and would probably be ok with it). we have tried assisted living care, but i find it really hard to find any resources. most group homes or things similar to this are super expensive as well. I don\u2019t know what to do! also, i wonder how the treatment is like in these type of places\u2026 how is the environment like? will he feel like a burden? I just have questions about how the living conditions and lifestyle is in these type of programs and if it\u2019s worth it? I want what\u2019s best for him and I fear that it\u2019s not at home anymore. It\u2019s too out of control. He needs professional help. "

For context I had a terrible psychosis episode last year in April and was hospitalised for over a month, I had a job at the time which I lost at the height of my episode (illegal?!). I was diagnosed as non-organic psychosis, stress related. I'm now actively job-hunting but finding it really hard. I'm on 5mg of Aripiprazole and 100mg of Palaperidone (Invega) and feel dumb, like I've lost my 'sharpness'. I used to have a high powered job doing New Business for advertising agencies but now find it tricky to do job interviews as I'm not performing how I used to. I seem to have more of a monotone voice now, a lot quieter and not as bubbly and have lost my spark and sass. \n\n  \nJust wondered if anyone had any advice or experienced similar and have found jobs or gone back to their old jobs and how they've found it. Wondering is it's the medication or just in my head.\n\n  \n"

My dad threatens her and tells her the psych ward is a terrible place and that she won\u2019t be allowed to come home again if she goes to the psych ward.

Or do you think her disorder has come to a point where she will always be in and out of psychosis? I only have hope in Clozapine since i am taking it myself and it is the most effective anti psychotic. But if she lies to her psychiatrist he obviously won\u2019t change meds. I don\u2019t know what to do with her. Besides all of that i have fear that i will end up like her, it seems terrible what she goes through every day. "

The point of this meditation is to feel the meaning of each word as deeply as possible. Having the attitude of this meditation even after you stop meditating is very important.\n\nMay the beings who send me events be filled with loving kindness, may they be well, may they be peaceful and at ease, and may they be happy.\nMay the beings who send me synchronicities be filled with loving kindness, may they be well, may they be peaceful and at ease, and may they be happy.\nMay the beings who send me meaningful visual hallucinations...\nMay the beings who send me meaningless visual hallucinations...\n...imagined visuals...\n...external voices...\nMay my external voices...\n...internal voices...\nMay my internal voices...\n...meaningful auditory hallucinations...\n...meaningless auditory hallucinations...\n...imagined sounds...\n...thoughts...\n...sensations...\n...muscle movements...\n...dreams...\nMay the beings who distract me...\nMay the beings who help me focus...\nMay my body...\nMay my mind...\nMay my spirit...\nMay I...\n\nAfter you do this, you can go through your 7 chakras and then everyone you know.

I\u2019m worried it\u2019s the start of something bigger. \n\nMy hallucinations tend to be of human voices. My common ones are a woman singing, a man calling my name or saying hey behind me with no one there, or sometimes I hear really distant screams. So this one is new.\n\nIt\u2019s some kind of beeping. It sounds different each day, but I haven\u2019t been able to figure out a pattern of it. My first one sounded deep with large intervals between. Then one day it sounded like a super distant fire alarm. I thought it was a fire alarm from an adjacent building in my apartment, but after it lasted the entire day I realized it wasn\u2019t. Today it\u2019s a more rapid beep.\n\nI went insane the first few days overturning my entire place trying to find out what was happening but I couldn\u2019t find anything. Eventually I realized it wouldn\u2019t get quieter or louder when I moved around, I figured that if it was an external sound it would change with distance I guess.\n\nI haven\u2019t hallucinated in so long. My mood is fine, actually better than it\u2019s been in a long time, but not in a mania way. It feels like I have my shit together, I sleep 7 hours every night, I eat well, I get all my work done. So I\u2019m kind of taken off guard that I randomly started hearing stuff. I\u2019m seeing my psychiatrist soon and I\u2019m documented everything to tell her the timeline, but I\u2019m worried this is the start of something bigger. \n\nThoughts? Advice?"

But she definitely has. \n\nAll her siblings are boys and got it early, and she\u2019s in her late 20\u2019s and started smoking weed last year.

But then I\u2019m completely fine. \n\nAnyone else have anything like this?"

It\u2019s the evening time and I walk into the hallway and am greeted by a shorter elder lady with scientific scrubs on and curly grey hair. She had a cool vibe to her almost T-Rex ish. She said, \u201cHey look at this!\u201d I walk over and she\u2019s holding a cellphone with a picture of a calendar with symbols. She said, \u201cthis is what they\u2019re planning.\u201d It had two black stars, two purple diamonds, two orange stars, two blue moons repeating throughout a calendar month in that format. I think it would be presidential candidates with Walz being a black star for his BLM riots in his state. Purple diamonds for Kamala. Orange star for Trump. Blue Moons for Vance because of his eyes. She then proceeded to tell me to, \u201clook out for blue moons\u201d. \n\nShe puts her phone away and starts walking down the hallway. I follow her back because she just had a cool vibe and she then proceeds to tell me, \u201cYou have a lot of grey matter.\u201d Now what human would say this without a proper brain scan? It\u2019s like she could read my mind, scan me, had super secret information, could talk to me beyond words, and was just one of the most amazing beings I\u2019ve met. We get to the end of the hallway (which this ward wing is one simple hallway with a window at the end). I stand about three feet from her and in my mind beg her to show me she isn\u2019t human. She kind of smiled a tiny bit and then proceeds to make her pupil blink sideways vertically. It just disappeared from the ends to the center and was just her iris color. Then she brought her pupil back to fill from center to ends. I turned my head sideways and said, \u201cthat f***ing blink\u201d I was super satisfied she showed me she wasn\u2019t human that I got a full wave a tiredness hit me all of sudden and I went back to my room and laid down and fell asleep. \n\nI woke up to her coming into my room with keys. I woke up and sat up and she walked back out of my room. I walked out into the hallway and started talking with her a little more. I didn\u2019t ask her the right questions I wish I would\u2019ve. All I asked is why I hear voices and her answer was, \u201csome of us are wired and some of us are wireless.\u201d I was thinking I was wired at the time but I don\u2019t know. \n\nSo yeah I got out about 2 weeks later and didn\u2019t see her the rest of the time. I would\u2019ve liked to have known more about her kind, who those plans were about, and who they were. Ask her her take on the afterlife and stuff but just she had a hold on me to make me a bit docile and forgetful.

I had never been able to find it for a really long time. my doctor suspected it could be stress from school, but it was always pretty easy for me to catch up (at least, before i started taking medication). my father suspected it was his arguments with my mother, but i stopped caring about their relationship a long time ago.\n\na few days ago i had an appointment with my psychologist (bless him, he's amazing) and he told me something that forever changed my perception of my illness.\n\n\"whenever your mind tells you things, it's only trying to protect you.\"\n\ni don't remember exactly how he said it, but it went something along the lines of that. it might've been obvious to him, but it was a whole revelation for me. \n\ni was chilling and listening to some music earlier. i fell sick to the common cold and had nothing else to do. that's when i started thinking about how all my delusions started. i remembered i had a period of my life which lasted about 2 years where i was mildly depressed. that might've been the prodromal phase. then i recalled what happened a few days before the onset on my psychosis. i was having multiple existential crises in a row. the thought of the meaning of my life and existence itself drove me crazy.\n\nthen, i realised.\n\nmy mind was trying to protect me from the absurdity of my own existence by attempting to give it a reason. any reason. all while not considering whether it would help or harm me. i didn't even know what was happening to me at that time. i was only 12.\n\nmy delusions had very nihilistic undertones. if i put the pieces together, i can confidently say that the reason for my psychosis is my utter confusion about my own existence and life itself.\n\nbut now, i realise life doesn't need a reason to be. even though it's all so absurd, it doesn't mean we can't bask in it. we give lives our own  meaning. \n\ni'll admit that this shouldn't have happened to me so early. but i am grateful that it gave me life experience most people my age don't have. i realised my purpose at a tender age. at the same time i feel really lucky that I'm as functional as i was years ago. i take showers everyday, i go to school and have friends i regularly talk to. it's safe to say i live a normal life now (although the unusual thoughts still bother me sometimes).\n\ni know not a lot of people are as functional as me and have this illness simultaneously. i also acknowledge that not everyone has the same trigger as me. but i hope in some way, shape or form, this has given you guys some insight.\n\nTLDR: my psychologist told me that when my mind tells me things, it's only trying to protect me. that's when i realised that due to my multiple existential crises, my mind fed me all these delusions just to give a reason to my existence. but now i realise life doesn't need a reason to be. we give our own meaning to our own lives"

    "content": "I don't have the disease but my twin sister does. In 2021 covid pandemic, my sister was acting weird. She always watching me even when I was asleep, eating, etc. I confronted  her about it and asked why she was doing that. Her answers did not make any sense. I told our mother about it. We decided to take her to psychiatrist when she threw her smartphone in a bucket of water and she was crying. This was the time I knew something was wrong with her, asking why she did that but she was not answering. My intuition was that all what she was doing were all related to her previous answers that did not make any sense. In doctor's office, my sister was first diagnosed as bipolar with pyschotic features. I was happy that she was given medicine that maybe she will be cured. Weeks passed by but no improvement and she also started to not take her medicine and her delusions keep changing. I was keen on telling her that if she think her previous delusion was not true, why would her present delusion make sense or true at all? But she aint believing me, we are always chaotic in the house, she graduated and passed the board exam but because of her condition, shes always at home fearing something thats not true at all. I have this constant reminder that with her disease she will have difficulty living peacefully. Her delusions keep worsening and fluctuate a lot from having happy delusions then back to persecutory delusions. But her delusions always revolve around her smartphone and apps like tiktok, instagram she was using for years. But she have several times breaking her phone, we bought again and cycle continue. I tried to keep her away from her phone that is one of her triggers but she wants it. I just dont like to take away the only thing she have to pass time. Years gone by but I don't see my sister improving at all and I lost all hope. Her delusions were still there and she became more loud as she keep screaming and crying and our neighbors are also affected by her condition. Our family really don't have money, our last resort is to get her to public psychiatric hospital where hundreds of patients are confined to and we dont want that for her, the facility don't have comfortable beds, only wood and most are lying on floor. The facility also look like a jail to me. But Me and my mother unfortunately did admitted my twin sister in that psychiatric hospital last week, we are eager to have her treated bec shes not taking her medicine. To have her treated with continuous take of medicine, we have to do that. I don't know if this is good decision, I just want to take back my sister again from this disease. I am reading posts here in subreddit and I am hopeful maybe her delusions would be gone. To someone having schizophrenia that had gone to psych hospital reading this, how long have you been in there to make the delusions disappear? "

    "content": "So, I shared an article about how doctors now believe neuroinflammation and central nervous system inflammation play a major role in schizophrenia. The inflammation causes certain pathways to be blocked, which leads to a surge in activity in other parts of the brain and an imbalance of dopamine and other neurotransmitters. Gut issues can cause neuroinflammation.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m finally getting over a gastritis flare-up, but it got me thinking: what if my schizophrenia and gut issues are connected? I really believe they are in my case, especially after reading the article I\u2019ll share. Before my first psychotic break, I knew nothing about probiotics or gut health. I would wake up, drink a huge Monster on an empty stomach, and eat terribly because I thought it didn\u2019t matter since I was always skinny.\n\nMy first gastritis flare-up happened when I was 20, three years before my first psychotic break. I couldn\u2019t eat solid food and dropped to 129 pounds (I\u2019m 6\u20191\u201d). I really think it\u2019s all linked. I experienced trauma when I was younger\u2014my mom is an alcoholic, so there was constant turmoil. I also have one aunt who\u2019s schizophrenic and another who\u2019s bipolar.\n\nI think genetics just make someone vulnerable, but they don\u2019t cause it outright. Exposure to trauma and extreme anxiety can damage the central nervous system, leaving you vulnerable and potentially setting you up for chronic inflammation in this area. But I think you need the perfect storm to activate it\u2014things like drug use or extreme stress.\n\nWhat do you all think?\n"

My body was buzzing, crawling even. I thought to myself \"this all seems very oddly psychotic, and manic. Maybe I should not leave the house. Considering I'm no stranger to this type of thing, am diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and take high dose seroquel.\" Happy with my self awareness I grabbed my vape and went for a walk. \n\n**This was the first mistake**\n\n-Elder Grof DJ Rozwell\n\nI was looking for music that may fit with the feeling of going for a walk, fitting with an aesthetic of \"half a tab of acid while having a panic attack in a serial killers bug infested basement\". I found that music with lyrics in it kinda fucked with me so I stumbled upon a song \"Elder Grof\". The cover featuring a wizard and the song being heavily bass boosted with a fantasy and dream like element to it. \n\nI put my phone in my pocket and looked up at the branches of the trees and saw the way they all warped. How unusual of a pattern they all were. How weird I must of seemed to the passerby walking, staring at the sky. The tree branches warping into words such as \"die\", ancient symbols but moreso many threats directed at me. And more in the ground. The way that the names of the streets suddenly reflected meaningful events to me. \n\nI had the same song on repeat, Though many of what I saw reflected danger, I felt like an adventurer, on a mission. I do not know how long i was out for but i came upon a cow pasture by my house. A single cow there, a patch of\u2026 stupid fucking grass\u2026 between the road and a barbed fence. I dont know why. I looked up at the cow, the sun now setting. The cow looked at me, the cows eyes, wide open as mine were. We held a mutual understanding. I thought in my head that maybe this cow was one of few who knew what I knew, could see what I could see. I decided to say some parting words \u201cyou're lucky **you're** the one behind this fence\u201d. I walked away before standing still. \n\nMy mind was frozen. My thoughts began to make little if any sense at all and became horribly disorganized and scrambled. \n\n\u201cI want to lay down in the road\u201d. (Not suicidally)\n\n\u201cI would be useful as an inanimate object\u201d \n\n\u201c..............\u201d \n\nMy skin was crawling much more and now I was seeing bugs more vividly on me. (Bonus: feeling a finger poke you from the wall). I stood by the side of the road for maybe an hour, the sun went down and I went home. \n\nThe next day I did more of the same sinking deeper and deeper. My partner was becoming more concerned about me. As we had a date the next day together. She was thinking of cancelling. I thought it wasn't necessary\u2026\n\nThis day was a blur but I doubt anything pleasant happened. But the next day. I would know very well what happened\n\n-Truama Hell Ride Wesley Willis \n\nI hopped onto the train toward center city Philadelphia, almost missing the train. I was asked to present my fare. Frantically, I grabbed for single dollars and counted them all, grabbing them way too hard, becoming super scared as the mans eyes beamed down on me. I dropped the dollars and picked them up as the train moved trying to not lose any. I handed them in a ball to the man. \u201cI have cash fare\u201d, I said. He shook his head and handed me my exit ticket. \n\nI do not like lyrics in this state but if I feel the song is on my frequency and fits the mood I may put it on. I put on truama hell ride by wesley willis. The song was written by a man with schizophrenia who would take the greyhound bus and have nightmare experiences. Because by now I was super scared and was beginning to 2nd guess my decision. \n\nI stared out the window and watched the rocks and trees in the Pennsylvania woods as they began to thin out the closer we got to the city.\n\nAn old woman sat next to me. This was okay though because i find old ladies to be comforting. \n\nI reached my destination and got out, leaving my exit fare. A man saw this and took it and tried to give it to me, intercepting me. \u201cEXCUSE ME SI-... UH MA'AM?\u201d. I became deeply terrified. \u201cI cant talk\u201d. I said. \u201cSIR. SIR.\u201d. I began to speed walk and he yelled louder. \u201cMAAM. MAAM!!!!!!\u201d. I ran as fast as I could, not knowing what he wanted, glancing behind me to see if I lost him. Eventually I found out\u2026 i forgot my exit fare. \n\nI ended up having to pay a lesser amount to get out of the station :/ \n\nI went up to market street to go and take the bus to where my partner is. Not remembering that buses stop at bus stops I stood at the side of the road. A security guard saw me, obviously out of my mind and asked me if I was okay and if I needed help finding anything in a concerned tone. Then pointed me towards where I needed to go. Then I realized my bus was there and I had just missed it, so I chased it down for a few blocks, the only passenger saw me and stopped the bus for me. \n\nI got on and paid my fare. The bus driver was very angry at me and said \u201cWHERE WERE YOU?! BECAUSE YOU WERENT AT A BUS STOP!\u201d. The yelling was freaking me out and making my state worse so I ended up explaining my predicament. Then he stopped yelling and became much more friendly with me and when we came to a stop where I was the only passenger he asked me if I was going to be okay. I said yes. He then took a bathroom break and I was locked in alone. \n\nEventually I reach the mall, to meet my love. I run around, with something that can be described as a heavy slouch and a bisexual speed walk while I'm dressed like femboy kurt cobain. \n\nEventually I hear \n\n\u201cHiiiiii \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u201d \n\nI look over to see my partner there. Who is aware of my issue though has never seen me in this state. I find every face terrifying, eyes read into your thoughts and soul. Human skin all looks dead. And yet her face still looked normal. \n\nI looked at her with a blank expression, not blinking. She smiles, takes my hand. \u201c\u2018hi <3. You have crazy eyes\u201d she says. \n\nWe try to go along with a normal date day but when I speak it comes out as gibberish. Everything I say sounds like a delusion. I'm speaking very fast, sometimes a mix of words that make no sense at all. \n\nWe go to the food court. And we? She tries an assortment of food. Becsuse I can't get past how everything is POISONED. MAN. I think \u201chow cool would it be to get a job as a psychotic ice cream taster. Easy money. Try 40 flavors. Scarf down the 40th pint, unbuckle your belt, and sigh in satisfaction. And tell your boss for the 40th time that day \u201ctastes like hints of *chew and lick*... poison \ud83e\udd14. Aged for about 13 years in the secret vineyard under the floorboards of my basement . 7/10 \u2764\u201d. I tell these kinds of jokes to her. She doesnt laugh. \n\nAlthough at a rough start the date becomes kinda more warm. Where I get the feeling she is one of few who can make sense of this madness. My hallucinations and anxiety become more bearable. Because they feed off my mind. Yet they dont feel like my thoughts. It feels like my brain picking up interference signals. This moment put it into my head that perhaps it is in my head. \n\nThis doesnt last though. \n\nThe date ends. I am not a smoker but I am puffing very fat clouds and put the wizard music back on. I believed that the nicotine may help. If it did it was no substitute for staying home or going to the ward like I fucking should of. I again wait at imaginary bus stops and I keep running between them and real bus stops. I miss 3 busses. Step onto the wrong bus. Step onto the right bus and then stop off when I couldnt say my destination. \n\nI am so frantic as my phone battery becomes low that I run through streets to get to where I think bus stops may be. I'm talking, 2, 4 lanes. Busy traffic at night. I am very scared by this and realize how stupid and fucking dangerous this is and that I now have the re-do it to get back to where I came. \n\nThe sidewalk is littered with needle caps and I see cop cars zoom by. Feeling like a wizard I ignore this. But more cop cars come and come before the streets are filled with sirens. \n\n(I take out my camera and snap photos of the following events. This is all real. Thoigh the amount of cars was less)\n\nThey all get out and like 10 cops start fighting this one woman who is screaming really loud. They all grab her but she wont go down and she persists and proceeds to walk and stay upright despite the cops grabbing onto her. Above me is a pedestrian bridge now filled with people watching in awe \"POLICE BRUTALITY\" they yell. \n\nI watch the whole thing beginning to end until she gets dragged into the highway streets and then into a cop car and driven away. The last cop on the scene looks at me and walks slowly toward me.\n\n\"YOURE NEXT\" \n\nMy brain says and I bolt off to nearby old navy. I charge my phone there and just so happens there is a REAL bus stop. I wait there and keep repeating and rehearsing my destination. \n\nI confuse the bus driver at first but he understands enough and I take a seat. He has this kind of savior glow around him and seeing this man makes me smile. How amazing he seemed to me. I felt he must of saved my life. A saint. A real saint. \n\nIf you were wondering yes I do have auditory hallucinations. They dont bother me much. Only one is a problem. Here's something funny. I'm having a nervous breakdown on the bus, in between drooling over this bus driver I guess. This voice that's always all \"go jump out a window\" \"everybody hates you\" takes a break and just says \"you should read a book\". Perhaps this was an insult. But I did and I took out a book. \n\n-dream a little dream of me Pied Pipers (hallucination version) \n\nI was hearing music. One of my comfort songs. Dream a little dream of me. It's hard to describe. It was the song. But it was corrupted. The lyrics were incomplete and parts of the song were missing and some verses repeated over and the chorus kicked in out of nowhere but when it did I wanted to cry it was so beautiful and I was quietly humming to myself. \n\nI decided to throw in the towel and text my friend who I known since third grade who was VERY well aware of my issues and understood me and didnt mind driving to come get me. And he didnt mind the company. He was very worried about my safety. \n\nI waited and got a slushy at a nearby 7/11. I went to use a self checkout and absolutely fucked that up and the clerk, not wanting to hurt my feelings told me the machine was broken  and helped me at the register. \n\nThe slushy... tasted like poison. Absolute shit. 1/10. \n\nMy friend picks me up and we suprisingly have a decent conversation though he later says he was very very concerned about me. \n\nI make it home safe that night but my problems would have only just begun. \n\nAs the mood went down, the insanity would persist into next month into the worst depression of my life. Delusion, paranoia and a hospitalization. \n\nStay safe. \n\nIf you have to question whether or not you're okay to do something big, and if other people begin to question if you are. Then, like running across 4 lanes of busy traffic, you're heading somewhere that you may not wanna be heading\n\nDont go wizard mode "

    "content": "\n\nfor those struggling with malignant voices that don't go, my persistent aural hallucinations just switched off, you have to convince them of the following idea in the paper, that schizophrenia is a fragmentation of the self and that those voices that hurt you are actually you in different dissociated states, you'll end up \"staring at yourself\" instead of paying constant attention to the voices, cause when they \"talk\" we \"stare\" at them, even if for a second, we give them our attention..and you'll switch it off (break the spell they have on us), \n\nSchizophrenia and the Inner Fragmented Self: Voices as Thoughts and the Path to Holistic Mental Health\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper explores the theory that auditory hallucinations, including voices, arise from the internal fragmentation of the self and are, in essence, misattributed thoughts. We examine how the disorganized thinking seen in schizophrenia can be explained by this fragmentation, where fragmented parts of the personality take on a life of their own and become disruptive. The paper also explores the potential of this theory to foster more holistic, community-based treatment approaches that focus on integrating fragmented parts of the self, empowering patients, and reducing stigma. This approach calls for a shift away from purely psychiatric methods toward patient-centered, compassionate care.\n\n\n---\n\nIntroduction\n\nHallucinations, particularly auditory ones like voices, are commonly associated with schizophrenia and other mental health conditions. Traditionally, these experiences have been viewed as external, otherworldly occurrences, often attributed to a malfunction in the brain's processing of sensory information. However, an emerging theory suggests that these hallucinations are not external forces but rather misattributed thoughts that arise from a malfunctioning or fragmented brain. In this view, the voices and other sensory experiences that people with schizophrenia hear are, in essence, their own thoughts that have been dissociated or fragmented and then misinterpreted as being outside the self.\n\nWhen parts of the personality or psyche become fragmented\u2014due to trauma, unresolved emotional conflicts, or stress\u2014the brain struggles to integrate these fragments into a coherent sense of self. As a result, these fragmented thoughts or emotions can take on a life of their own and appear as voices or other forms of hallucinations. This malfunction in the brain's ability to integrate and attribute thoughts correctly can cause the voices to feel alien, separate, and distressing. By understanding these hallucinations as internal, fragmented thoughts rather than external forces, we open up new avenues for treatment that focus on reintegration and self-compassion.\n\nThis paper explores how viewing hallucinations as misattributed thoughts can lead to more holistic, community-based approaches to mental health. It emphasizes the need for patient-centered care that seeks to reintegrate these fragmented aspects of the self rather than simply eliminating the symptoms. Additionally, we discuss therapeutic approaches that involve engaging with the voices directly, helping individuals understand and integrate them into a more cohesive sense of self.\n\n\n---\n\nThe Theory of Voices as Misattributed Thoughts\n\n1. Internal Fragmentation of the Self\n\nIn this theory, voices are not foreign or external, but rather the fragmented parts of the person\u2019s psyche that have become dissociated. These fragmented aspects of the self\u2014often shaped by trauma, internal conflict, or emotional wounds\u2014become detached from the person\u2019s core identity. As a result, they appear as separate entities, including the voices heard in auditory hallucinations.\n\nDisassociation and Fragmentation: When different aspects of the self become dissociated, they can take on a life of their own. These dissociated fragments may include emotions, memories, or parts of the personality that have been pushed away from conscious awareness. As these fragments are not integrated into the whole self, they begin to emerge as voices or other sensory hallucinations.\n\nErratic and Disorganized Thinking: The presence of these fragmented thoughts disrupts the natural flow of thinking. In schizophrenia, where thoughts are frequently interrupted by voices or other internal disruptions, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain coherent, organized thought patterns. This aligns with the phenomenon of disorganized thinking, which is commonly observed in individuals with schizophrenia. The fragmentation of the self leads to confusion, fragmented thought processes, and difficulty in staying focused on a single thread of thought.\n\n\n\n---\n\nSensory Hallucinations and the Role of the Brain\n\n1. Voices as Sensory Hallucinations\n\nThe theory of fragmentation also helps explain why these voices can feel so real and external, especially when they are auditory. When a part of the self becomes dissociated and takes on an autonomous nature, it can trigger the brain\u2019s sensory pathways, particularly those associated with hearing.\n\nTriggering Sensory Areas: The auditory areas of the brain, which are typically activated when we hear external sounds, can also be activated when these fragmented parts of the self \u201cspeak.\u201d The voice is experienced as coming from outside, even though it originates from within the person\u2019s mind.\n\nMultisensory Hallucinations: This same mechanism can apply to other forms of sensory hallucinations, such as visual, tactile, or olfactory experiences. When fragmented parts of the self are triggered, they may affect different sensory systems, creating a multisensory experience that feels entirely separate from the self.\n\n\n\n---\n\nOpportunities for Holistic and Community-Based Approaches\n\nViewing voices and hallucinations as internal, fragmented parts of the self opens up significant opportunities for more holistic and community-based approaches to mental health. These approaches emphasize understanding, integration, and self-compassion rather than simply managing symptoms with medication.\n\n1. Reintegration of the Self: If voices are viewed as fragmented aspects of the person\u2019s internal world, therapeutic work can focus on reintegrating these parts of the self into a more cohesive identity. This process of reintegration helps individuals better understand the origins of their voices, creating a more integrated sense of self.\n\n\n2. Empowerment Through Understanding: Holistic approaches empower individuals by giving them agency over their experiences. Instead of seeing voices as something to be eradicated, individuals can learn to view them as parts of themselves that need healing. By working with therapists, individuals can explore what these voices represent\u2014whether they are emotions, unresolved memories, or fragmented personality traits\u2014and move toward integrating these parts of themselves.\n\n\n3. Reducing Stigma and Isolation: A community-based approach to mental health recognizes the value of support systems in fostering recovery. In these communities, individuals can share their experiences in safe, nonjudgmental spaces, reducing the isolation and stigma often associated with schizophrenia. Mental health activism plays a critical role in advocating for these types of inclusive, patient-centered environments.\n\n\n\nPeer Support: Peer support groups can be essential in helping individuals who hear voices feel understood. These groups provide opportunities for people to share strategies, find common ground, and offer emotional support.\n\nHolistic Care Practices: In addition to traditional therapeutic interventions, holistic care might include mindfulness practices, yoga, meditation, or even art therapy. These practices help individuals reconnect with their inner world and develop greater self-compassion.\n\n\n\n---\n\nTherapeutic Approaches to Voices: Engaging Directly with the Voices\n\nRather than simply trying to eliminate voices, therapeutic approaches can be focused on understanding, integrating, and transforming the relationship between the person and the voices. This can be achieved through methods where the therapist helps the patient engage with the voices themselves, rather than viewing them purely as symptoms to be rid of. This approach acknowledges that the voices may hold valuable insight into the individual\u2019s emotional or psychological struggles.\n\n1. Voice Dialogue Therapy: One innovative therapeutic approach is Voice Dialogue Therapy, which helps individuals interact directly with the voices they hear. In this model, the therapist facilitates conversations between the patient and the voices, treating the voices as parts of the person\u2019s inner world. This therapeutic technique allows individuals to express their feelings toward the voices and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying emotional conflicts. It can also help demystify the voices, reducing their power and distress.\n\nThe Role of the Therapist: The therapist helps guide the patient through a structured process of dialoguing with the voices. They encourage the patient to \u201clisten\u201d to the voices, understand their messages, and explore the emotions or unresolved conflicts that might be driving the voices. This method fosters empowerment by helping the patient take an active role in the therapeutic process, transforming their relationship with the voices.\n\nIntegration of Fragmented Parts: By engaging with the voices, the patient can begin to reintegrate the fragmented parts of themselves that the voices represent. The voices may symbolize suppressed emotions, unmet needs, or unresolved trauma, and by addressing them directly, the patient can work through these issues and move toward greater psychological coherence.\n\n\n\n2. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): CBT can still be used to address the negative beliefs and distress associated with the voices. However, in this context, it can be adapted to help the patient change their perception of the voices. For example, instead of viewing the voices as entirely separate or alien, CBT can help the patient recognize them as parts of their own thought process that have become fragmented. Over time, this helps reduce the emotional power the voices hold over the individual.\n\n\n3. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT): ACT encourages individuals to accept the voices without judgment, seeing them as part of their broader experience. This acceptance can extend to \u201caccepting\u201d the voices as part of the person\u2019s inner world. Through ACT, individuals are taught to defuse from their voices\u2014seeing them not as threatening or alien, but as transient thoughts that do not define their sense of self. This helps the patient gain psychological flexibility and learn to live a meaningful life regardless of the voices.\n\n\n4. Narrative Therapy: Narrative Therapy involves helping the patient reframe their experiences with voices as part of their larger life story. The therapist can assist the patient in understanding the role that these voices play in the context of their personal narrative. This reframing can lead to greater self-understanding and help the patient view the voices not as an enemy but as something to be integrated into their broader sense of self.\n\n\n5. Integrative Therapy: Integrative therapy combines multiple modalities to help individuals connect with and work through fragmented parts of the self. For people who hear voices, this approach might involve not just cognitive techniques but also emotional, somatic, and even artistic expressions. Art therapy, for example, can be a valuable tool for externalizing and engaging with the voices in a nonverbal way. This can help the individual explore the emotions or meanings associated with the voices in a more embodied, creative manner.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nConclusion\n\nThe theory of voices as fragmented thoughts offers a compassionate and integrated framework for understanding auditory hallucinations and other forms of dissociation in schizophrenia. By recognizing that these voices are parts of the self that have become dissociated, we can develop more holistic and community-based approaches to mental health that focus on reintegration and self-compassion. Rather than seeing voices as external forces to be eliminated, patients can view them as opportunities for self-exploration, emotional healing, and empowerment. A shift towards more inclusive, patient-centered care\u2014fueled by mental health activism\u2014can reduce stigma, promote self-agency, and improve the quality of life for individuals experiencing these symptoms.\n\n\n---\n\nReferences\n\nChadwick, P., Birchwood, M., & Trower, P.

    "content": "I am wondering if anyone here has been diagnosed and later developed more intense tactile hallucinations.\n\nI was diagnosed 3 years ago but assumed to have been living with my illnesses since i was a child.\n Over the years ive had tactile hallucinations (bugs under my skin, organs moving) but in the last few months I have had just serious issues. I get chest pain, pains up my neck, tingling in my body, ill be looking around and my vision will start to go out and i think im going blind or dying. I feel my organs shift around. I get burning sensations in my body in various locations..i think my veins are exploding. Its odd, truly just not fun feelings. \n I dont know if its just panic but it starts up out of nowhere, and it is just really hard to manage. I try to sum it up to general feelings (gas, posture, etc) but it doesn't make it go away,  just helps me calm down. \n\nI have spoken to my psych about the issues. \nWe switched my meds, because i thought thats what was causing it and its not as severe now but they still happen and now more of a variety of \"symptoms\" are appearing. To top it off google is not my friend in this at all, and i should be banned from googling symptoms. Fuels the fire. \n\nAll that to say i have had every scan run, every pannel for blood done, and im in great shape, nothing wrong as far as the stats go. I can't help but think something is wrong REGARDLESS of everything saying otherwise. Then i had an idea this evening that maybe its just hallucinations.\n\n I dont know how to approach this mentally as it happens, i don't know if tactile hallucinations like this can flare up out of nowhere. Not so sure what its all about. \n\n I talk to my therapist this month so ill get his help with this. In the mean time im just looking for other expierences. \nMuch thanks friends for those who read this.  I appreciate any response."

A friend of mine asked if I wanted to live together with her today, and I said yes. Sometimes I wish I lived alone, but I  think I'd struggle more with taking care of myself living alone. I also don't think my friend fully realises how I can get. I think I can be pretty depressing to be around at times, and sometimes maybe uncomfortable to be around. I know my mother gets stressed and affected when I'm in a bad way.\n\nI'm both excited and terrified about moving out, but I think it'll be good for me. I had already been planning to move out sometime in the future, but that had been with the thought of being alone.\n\nWhat has worked out best for you?\n\n"

It ended after I said something I shouldn't have, then realized I wasted 2 years of her life and I needed to remove myself out of her life for her own good. I've always known she was above me but I finally came to the right headspace and realized I needed to stop holding her down and she needs to find someone better. Obviously, I realize it was for her own good, but it doesn't mean I don't miss her and its not hard on me. Especially when I nonstop hear her voice telling me things. Shes everywhere. Everything reminds me of her and her voice lets me know. I went to a cafe today when I ordered tea. I suddenly heard her giggle \"I used to love earl gray, remember?!\" and then I was watching a show and randomly heard her singing the theme song. The worst part is, her emotions replicate mine, so when I cry over the memories of her, I hear things like \"I needed you and you left.\" or \"You thought it was for my own good, but you were all I had.\" I locked myself in my bathroom and heard her bang on the door. I dont understand how my brain is perfectly replicating her voice, and its killing me that I can still have conversations with her even after not speaking for three months. I will never be able to get over her when I hear her every day, and I wanted to know if anyone else deals with hallucinations of people they actually know. "
